            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>Eightly, concerning the courſe taken in this replie; be the Reader advertiſed. 1. that therin nothing is dealt vvith, but the Doctors text, and other places of ſcripture pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, excepting ſuch vvriters as are alleaged for interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of them, and the clearing of the Refuter from the
<pb facs="tcp:14068:6"/> ſlanders layd upon him for miſalleadging them. And the reaſon is, both becauſe the ſcriptures onely can (and are alone ſufficient) to decide the maine controverſy concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the right of the epiſcopall function; and alſo for that the Doctor rejecteth all nevve vvriters as parties and inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent, for the ſame cauſe for vvhich, the refuter might aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvel reject the old, were they (as they are not) ſuch Biſhops and of his ſide, as he pretendeth. 2. The D. is not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed ſtepp by ſtepp in his ovvne order throughout his vvhole book, but that vvhich lieth ſtraggling here &amp; there, is dravvne togither into one tracte, aſvvell concerning his text, as the reſt of the ſcriptures alleadged by him 3. nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are the 5. pointes of his ſermon handled in the ſame order; for, the firſt of them concerning the Elderſhip, is put off to the laſt place, it being proved to perteyn nothing to the maine queſtion. 4. The vvhole is divided into three partes; in the firſt vvhereof are 3. bookes, the firſt concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Refuters preface, the 2. concerning the fitnes of the Doctors choiſe of his text, the diviſion &amp; analyſis thereof, togither vvith the ſtate of the queſtion, &amp;c. the 3. concerning the true and genuine ſenſe of his text, and whatſoever he ſpeaketh of it. In the 2. part, firſt, all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſcriptures alleadged by him for proof of the queſtion are dealt with; and then the Refuter is cleared of falſifying and miſapplying many teſtimonies of humane writers, wherewith the Doctor often chargeth him; by occaſion whereof it is made manifeſt, that many of the D. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were neyther ſuch Biſhops, nor yet of the D. opinion concerning the pointe in queſtion, as he affirmeth. In the third part is handled that firſt point of his, concerning the Elderſhippe.</p>

Now which part of the proverb, belongeth to the Refuter in his preface, and which to the Doctor in his anſwer to it; let the indifferent reader (ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum allegata et probata) judge, in the feare of God, and ſpare not. And firſt as the Refuters eye was upon the ſcope of the Doctors ſermon; ſo is the D. eye vpon the ſcope of the Ref. preface; the former I ſuppoſe looking right forwards, the later quite awrie. For what can an eye not evilly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, ſee in that preface, that ſhould charge the Refuter in the ſcope therof, <hi>like an Orator in his proeme to drawe and withdraw his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> (as he ſayth from the D. to the Ref.) if <hi>he would be ledd by ſhews?</hi> when, without any oratoricall ſhewes at all, he plainly declareth the reaſon, that moved him to anſwer the ſermon.</p>
                     <p>2. Where the refuters whole preface is but as a prologue; the D. divideth it into a <hi>prologue and an epilogue;</hi> as if one ſhould divide a Lions head, into the head of a Lion, and the taile of a Lion. But if it were not all a prologue, yet to divide an entire ſpeach, into a <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue &amp; an epilogue,</hi> without any <hi>protaſis</hi> or <hi>epitaſis</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming betweene, is as if one ſhould divide a mans body into head and feete. As for his nice diviſion and ſubdiviſion folowing, I mind not to trouble the reader with them.</p>
                     <p>3. Where the refuter profeſſeth, that <hi>he deemed the D. ſermon as needful to be anſwered as any book written of that ſubject:</hi> The D. firſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:14068:8"/> a ſcoffe, which I here paſſe by; &amp; then by way of analyſing, maketh his refuter to tell his reader, how <hi>there weee two motives that moved him to vndertake it: Strong opinion, and vnquiet deſire:</hi> which is in deed to torture and not to analize words. His ſtrong opinion was, <hi>that he deemed it as needful to be anſwered as any book &amp;c.</hi> which as the D. telleth us, <hi>though the refuter confirmeth with divers reaſons, yet they are ſuch, as he that ſhal compare them, either with the truth or his opinion, or one of them with another, he ſhall ſee a pleaſant repreſentatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Matachin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But firſt, his logick faileth him; for a man that looketh with his right eye, may eaſily diſcerne, that the ref: brought but one onely reaſon for that his opinion; the other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or reaſons (as it pleaſeth the D. to number them, for it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth he had on thoſe ſpectacles that maketh a man to ſee <hi>gemmae ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecta, geminos ſoles)</hi> doe but prove the conſequent of that reaſon. 2. as for the <hi>Matachine</hi> fight, I perſwade my ſelf, it will (upon due ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of particulars) prove onely but ſome <hi>spectrum,</hi> ariſing out of that ſtrong imagination, which many times maketh any thing ſeeme to be, what the <hi>fantaſtick</hi> deſireth it ſhould be. The Refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wordes, in which the Doctor ſeeth theſe marveils, are to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>That when he ſaw how his ſermon tended directly to prove, that the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of our Lord Biſhops (as they now exerciſe it in the Church of England) is not onely lawful and good, but to be holden jure divino; not as an humane or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, their ancient and wonted tenure, but by divine right, as the very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ordinance of Chriſt: he demed it as needful to be anſwered as any book of that ſubject &amp;c. For that (notwithſtanding the D. commendation of it) it is evident, the doctrine thereof is utterly falſe, very huriful and obnoxious, and therfore neceſſary to be confuted.</hi> Would not any man think him driven to goe nere the wind, that rayſeth up ſuch tragedies, and logicall clatterings upon theſe words? or cannot he, trow we, ſee farr into a milſtone, that can ſee a matachine fight in them? Well, let us ſee how the D. proveth it.</p>

Let the Doctor deale plainly and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to the point directly. Is it an untruth in the ref: to ſay, that his ſermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tendeth directly to prove that the calling of our Biſhops is to be holden <hi>jure divino,</hi> by <hi>divine right,</hi> and not as an humane or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance? <note place="margin">by God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> lawe.</note> Why then dooth he not directly contradict this aſſertio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and ſay, that his ſermon tendeth ro prove, that their calling is to be holden, <hi>jure humano,</hi> by <hi>humane right,</hi> and not as a divine ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance? Or if they hold their calling by another right, which is neither <hi>humanum</hi> nor <hi>divinum jus;</hi> why is he aſhamed plainly to profeſſe, what it is? hath he preached a whole ſermon in defence of their honourable function, &amp; publiſhed foure books in defence of his ſermon, and yet dareth not directly proclaime quo jure they hold their ſuperiority? But let us touch a litle ſome points of his ſermon, and of his defence therof. Was not the callings of theſe 7. angels of which the text ſpeaketh, of divine right? and doth he not affirme (pag 2) and profeſs plainly to prove, <hi>that the reverent fathers of our Church,</hi> (for the ſubſtance of their calling) were ſuch?</p>
                     <p>2. Are not the true proper Paſtors of the Church, the lights and ſtarres of the Church, of divine right? and doth he not (pag. 3. &amp; 93) affirme our Dioceſan Biſhops to be ſuch? their calling therfore, (that honourable function of theirs) muſt eyther be of <hi>divine right,</hi> or the Churches of God themſelves are not of divine right.</p>
                     <p>3. Doth he not in divers places of his ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>rmon call it an apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall ordinance &amp; affirme it, to be from heaven, from God, alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divers ſcriptures for the proof therof?</p>
                     <p>4. Yea, is not the doctrine which he rayſeth from his text, (&amp; in the explicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and applicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wherof, his whole ſermon is ſpent) ſet dovvn by himſelf (pag 94) in theſe very words, ſc. <hi>that the epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall

And doth he not ayme at the ſame right, when he ſayth, it is <hi>the ordinance of Chriſt by his Apoſtles</hi> (lib. 3. pag. 24, 35. 44. 48, 59.) and that many of his allegations doe juſtify the ſuperiority of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops not onely de facto, but alſo de jure, and give teſtimonie to their right? eſpetially when he ſayth (pag 26.) that his allegation of thoſe fathers which adjudged Aerius an heretick, doth therfore prove the ſuperioritie of Biſhops de jure, becauſe there is no here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, which is not repugnant to Gods word.</p>
                     <p>6. Neyther can he otherwiſe warrant their calling and function, to be <hi>an holy calling, an high and ſacred function</hi> (as he affirmeth it to be in his epiſtle dedicatory to the King (pag 3, 4.) unles the right and title they have unto it, be divine and from God, who ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth whatſoever is holy.</p>
                     <p>7. Laſtly, ſeing he denieth (in his ſecond page of his anſwere to the preface) their auncient tenure to be jure humano, and for proof thereof affirmeth that their function was in the ptimitive CHVRCH acknowledged to be an ordinance Apoſtolicall: yf there be any ſtrength in his reaſoning, it will followe that he eſteemeth their tenure to be jure divino; ſeing he mainteyneth their function to be a divine ordinance. For if an ordinance Apoſtolicall, will conclude their tenure to be jure apoſtolico and not jure humano onely; then a divine ordinance wil prove their tenure to be jure divino, and not Apoſtolico onely.

Let us view his words and referre them to his purpoſe, vidz. to ſhew what was Ieroms meaning when he ſayth, <hi>that Biſhops are greater then Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, rather by the cuſtome of the Church, then by the truth of divine diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. If,</hi> ſayth he, <hi>Ierom meant that Biſhops were not ſet over Preſbyters by Apoſtolicall ordinance, he ſhould be contrary to all antiquity and to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. But if his meaning ſhalbe that their ſuperiority, (though it be an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolicall tradition, yet) is not direrectly of divine inſtitution; there is ſmal dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt theſe two; becauſe what was ordeyned of the Apoſtles, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from God, what they did in the execution of their Apoſtolicall function, they did by direction of the holy Ghoſt.</hi> But yet for <hi>more evidence</hi> he ſayth, <hi>he wil directly and breiffly prove, that the epiſcopall function is of divine inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, or that Biſhops were ordeyned of God.</hi> And as he ſayth ſo, ſo he aſſayeth to doe ſo, from the inſtances of <hi>Timothy and Archippus,</hi> eſpecially from his text, from whence he ſayth, <hi>it may evidently be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. 1. for that they are called angels, which not onely ſheweth their excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, but alſo proveth that they were authorized &amp; ſent of God. 2. for that they are commended vnder the name of ſtarres, to ſignify both their preeminence of dignity in this life, that they are the crowne of the Church. Revel. 12. 1. and their prerogative of glorie, which they ſhall have in the world to come, Dan. 12. 3. 3ly. for that they be the 7. ſtarres which Christ holdeth in his right hand, both for approbation of function &amp; protection of perſon.</hi> And ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth that he hath <hi>thus proved the doctrine ariſing out of his text, that the epiſcopal function is of Apoſtolicall and divine inſtitution.</hi> If theſe be his words; how dooth he directly &amp; expreſſely diſclayme, that the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Biſhops is to be holden by divine right? is he not a man of ſtrange conceit, that thinketh with outfacing, to add credit to ſo evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t an untruth? Yet he bluſheth not to mainteyne it by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">The D. 2. untruth to colour his ſlander; wch if it were true conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not the point.</note> untruth, which (though it were as true as, it is falſe) conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not what he indeavoureth to make good. <hi>I did profeſs</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>pag. 92. that although I hold the calling of Biſhops in respect of their firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, to be an apoſtolicall, &amp; ſo a diviue ordinance: yet that I do not main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyn it to be divini iuris, as intending therby, that it is generally perpetually &amp; immutably neceſſarie.</hi> From hence, if he wil conclude, that therfore he did directly and expreſſly diſclaime, (in the ſame page) what his
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:14068:10"/> Refut: ſayth he laboured in his ſermon to prove, ſcz. <hi>that the calling of our Biſhops is to be holden by divine right and not as an humane ordinance;</hi> ſhall he not ſhew himſelf a weak diſputer, and not wel adviſed what he ſpeaketh? For which of the D. friends, that adviſedly compareth the partes of his reaſoning togither ſeeth not, that a man in his right witts, will never take the profeſſing of the former, to be a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and expreſs diſclayming of the later? yea, he that is not over partiall may ſee, (by that which is already ſhewed) that the ſame pen which now profeſſeth, that he doth not mainteyne the epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall function to be divini juris, as intending therby a perpetuall &amp; immutable neceſſity therof; doth notwithſtanding underhand (&amp; by neceſſary conſequence) proclaime that it is to be holden jure divino, by divine right, and not as an humane ordinance. I add for the preſent, that this wil be concluded from that which here he profeſſeth. For he that holdeth the calling of Biſhops, to be an Apoſtolical and ſo a divine ordinance, doth in effect affirme it to be divini juris: as meaning thereby that it is a divine &amp; not an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ordinance. But there is leſs truth then he preſumeth, in that branch of his profeſſion, which ſayth, that he <hi>did profeſs pag 92, that he doth not mainteyn the calling of Biſhops to be divini iuris, as intending therby that it is generally &amp; immutably neceſſary.</hi> For he hath no one word in all that page that can cleare him of profeſſing an untruth in ſo ſpeaking. In deed in the later part of his marginal annotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he telleth us, <hi>that in reſpect of perpetuitie,</hi> difference is made by ſome, betwixt <hi>thoſe things that be divini, and thoſe which be apoſtolici iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, the former in their underſtanding, being generally perpetually and immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably neceſſary, the later not ſo.</hi> But dooth he make himſelf one of thoſe <hi>ſome</hi> that make that difference, and is of that vnderſtanding? it ſeemeth no, by the words, <hi>by ſome in their underſtanding;</hi> yea it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth no, by the words in the body of the book, (even right againſt them where he ſayth, <hi>ther is ſmall difference as he vnderſtandeth divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; becauſe what the Apoſtles did in the execution of their apoſtolicall function, they did it by the direction of the holy Ghoſt; ſo that they might true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaye of their ordinances, It ſeemed good to the holy Ghost and to us Act. 15. 28. &amp;c.</hi> For though the D. ſhould (now upon his later thoughts) put a difference between an ordinance divine or apoſtolicall, &amp; jus divinum or apoſtolicum; yet the direction of the Ho. Ghoſt, which acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panied the Apoſtles in the execution, wil as ſtrongly conclude

Wherfore it wil be an harder mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the D. ſuppoſeth, to work his marginall note ſo to accord with thetext of his book, that he may deduce fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence ſuch a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as here he tendreth, when he ſaith, <hi>that he profeſſeth pag 92 not to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>he D. doth not mainteyn the calling of Biſhops to be divini juris, as intending thereby the necſſity and perpetuitie aforeſayd; doubtleſs the ſame eye, which diſcerneth this acknowledgment, doth alſo no leſſe clearely perceive, that the Doctor mainteyneth their calling to be divini juris ſo farr (though not any further then) as he holdeth it to be a divine inſtitution, or an ordinance of God. And from hence we may ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gather, that he plainly profeſſeth the epiſcopall function to be divini juris, as intending therby that the firſt iuſtitution therof proceeded from God, and not from mens diviſe, as other humane ordinances. And therfore once agayn, I may conclude that the D. maliciouſly ſlandereth his Refut: in charging him with an untruth ſaying, <hi>that he ſaw his ſermon tended directly to prove that the calling of Biſhops is to be holden iure divino, by divine right and not as an humane or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance.</hi>

Moreover, ſince the Dr. is driven for his owne advantage, both here and in many other parts of his defence (Anſwer, to the preface pag. 7. libr. 3. pag. 57. libr 4. pag. 140. 145.) to ſhroud himſelf vnder this his Ref: acknowledgment; with what conſcience can he requite his kindenes ſo ill, as he doth, with this falſe impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation <note place="margin">A third un truth of the D. often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated.</note> (ſo often repeated lib. 3. pag. 22. 58. lib. 4. pag. 140. 145.) namely, <hi>that his Ref. chargeth him with ſaying, that the epiſcopall function it divini juris or to be holden jure divin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Biſhops is held by ſuch a divine right as here he diſclaymeth. It is enough to ſalve the Ref: aſſertion from an vntruth, and to returne back the vntruth into the Ds. boſome, if it appeare (as it doth ſufficiently) that the D. holdeth it any way to be divini juris, and not an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ordinance onely.</p>
                     <p>4. But if the D. meaning (in his profeſſion before ſett downe) be to ſhew, that he holdeth the epiſcopall function to be an apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolicall and ſo a divine ordinance, becauſe the Apoſtles who or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned it, were therein directed by the holy Ghoſt, and yet deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it to be divini juris, becauſe it is not generally perpetually and immutably neceſſary, as though there could be no true Church without it: this conſtruction of his words doth rather increaſe, then diminiſh his fault. For as it is falſe to ſay that he profeſſeth any ſuch diſtinction in that 92. pag. of his ſermon; ſo it is both falſe and ſlanderous to ſay that his Ref. acknowledgeth any ſuch thing in that 90. page of his anſwere. And if he doe (in his judgment) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe of that diſtinction, which he ſayth (in his margin) ſome doe putt between jus apoſtolicum and divinum, he bewrayeth therein no ſmall weaknes of judgement. Moreover it is an error in divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, either to think that every ordinance which is juris divini, is ſo generally and perpetually neceſſarie, that no true Church can be without it: or to deny ſuch an ordinance to be juris divini, as is of ſo generall and perpetuall an uſe, as he eſteemeth and affirmeth the epiſcopall function to be in divers pages of his ſermon. pag. 32. 35. 72. 74. 75. &amp; 79. (put togither by the Ref. pag. 158. of his anſwere,) where he teacheth cleane contrary to his profeſſion here. But for the better clearing of the ſtate of the queſtion, and ſhewing the vanitie and vnſoundnes of this diſtinction; I referr-the reader to the 3. 4. &amp; 5. Chapters of the ſecond book; here, I doubt not, enough being ſaid to free the Ref. from the guilt of that vntruth, <note place="margin">Sect. 3. pag 3 of the Ref. &amp; pag 2. of the D.</note> which the D. here chargeth upon him.</p>

If not but that it is common to many to be ſo blinded with partiallity and prejudice, that they ſee not that to be falſe, which is evidently falſe; and not ſtrange to others ſhameleſly to bend their witts to mainteyne manifeſt and groſſe vntruthes, againſt as cleare a light as the Sun caſteth at noon dayes: muſt they not therfore be refuted, becauſe they are manifeſt? Is the D. ignorant that the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; learned Fathers of old confuted diverſe vanityes, <hi>ſome of which were</hi> ſo evidently falſe, that they could ſay, <hi>recitaſſe eſt refutaſſe?</hi> Yea ſo groſly falſe and in the face vntrue; that the refuter of them, ſaith <hi>They will fall of them ſelves &amp;c.</hi> Was it not a doctrine utterly and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently falſe, <hi>that Chriſt was not God?</hi> needed it not therefore to be confuted? the Fathers verily were but vaine men then. What? ſhall I need ſaie any more to this? did the D. himſelf never deeme it needfull to confute a point, which in his judgment and the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all (if we maye beleeve him) that are not partiall, is vtterly falſe? doth he not affirme ſo of the preſbyterian diſcipline (as he calleth it) calling it a <hi>fancie, a novelty that bewrayeth the falſity, a mere humane invention, a newe device &amp;c.</hi> And doth he not (all this not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding) beſtowe firſt a longe ſermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and then a large defence, for confutation of what is ſaid for it? me thinkes therefore the D. is quite of the hookes in his thus reaſoninge. <hi>Things manifeſtly true or falſe are ſo judged in deed without diſputation or diſcourſe;</hi> but it is by them, ſure, to whome they appeare ſo, not to others; to others they are ſo judged by diſputation and diſcourſe. It is true alſo,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:14068:13"/> 
                        <hi>that nether doth any thing need to be argued or diſputed, but that which is not evident:</hi> but knoweth he not alſo, that nothing is to be confuted, but that which is evident, whiles it is not evident, it muſt be argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and diſputed: but when the falſhood is evident, it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed.</p>
                     <p>Thus we ſee how ſtoutly this reaſon fighteth with the Ref. o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion; the D. ſhould now ſhew us how it fighteth with it ſelf; but (whatſoever the matter is) he hath not a word to that end; the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hath leave to work that out by his own imagination. Let us paſſe on to the ſecond reaſon of the three (pretended by the D.) called by him the <hi>ſecond braneh,</hi> thus framed by him on the Refuters behalf. <hi>It is very huriful and abnoxi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But if it were not; yet hereby appeareth, how apt he is to take his brother by the throat, not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving him the leaſt ſyllabicall ſlipp, but making him pay the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt farthing. If his adverſary ſhould uſe him after that manner, ful oft perhaps might he be twitched up for halting: But lett the D. make the word ſound what he will, the reader may ſee, <hi>that the Eagle is hungry when ſhe catcheth at ſuch flies;</hi> and the Refut: meaning and ſo his words (indifferently conſtrued) doe ſound, that it is a <hi>doctrine hurtful and worthy of blame, and therefore to be confuted:</hi> what ſayth he to the reaſon? he onely denieth it to be <hi>hurtful;</hi> and why? <hi>For I not onely ſayd, ſaith he, but proved alſo both in the preface &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the ſermon, that it was both profitable and neceſſary.</hi> Which, what is it bur a ſilly begging even of the mayn queſtion?

(not a proof but) <hi>an application</hi> of that which before he pretendeth to have proved. And if the Refuter had not diſproved his proofes, both in preface and concluſion and whereſoever elſe, as he hath (at
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:14068:13"/> leaſt deemed himſelf to have) done, yet is the matter under triall ſtill. What then hath the Doct. here done, but as if a man making claime of ſome parcell of land, and bringing forth to that end, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne deeds to prove his title; wherevnto when his adverſary ſhall plead forgery or inſufficiencie, he ſhould think it ſufficient for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynder to ſay, he hath not onely ſayd his title is good, but proved it by the deeds aforeſayd. How the Refuter hath diſproved the D. proofes, whether ſufficiently or otherwiſe mattreth not in this point; ſure it is the matter remayneth ſtill queſtionable; yea had he not at leaſt made ſome ſhewe of a ſufficient diſproof of them; what needed ſo wiſe a man as M. D. to make ſo great a volume of defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? he told us even now, (I cannot yet forget it,) <hi>that nothing need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be argued or diſputed, but that which is not evident.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Come we now to the Ref: words, which the D. maketh his third reaſon. The third, ſayth he, <hi>It is neceſſary indeed to be confuted, as if he had ſayd, it is neceſſary indeed to be confuted, therefore it is moſt needful to be anſwered.</hi> That clauſe of the Refuter is an epiphonematical repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the maine concluſion and nothing elſe, as he that joyneth vit and honeſty togither may eaſily ſee: but the Doctor maketh it a different argument that he may make a child of his adverſary; &amp; his reader to imagine, that he beggeth the queſtion and proveth idem per idem: but lett the judicious, judge of his dealing herein, and honour him for it as he ſeeth cauſe; to me it ſeemeth an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie cauſe, that is gladd to feed upon any thing. Thus much for the Matachine fight charged vpon the refuters reaſons, how true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; I leave to the readers ſentence.</p>
                     <p>The Doctor goeth on and telleth vs how his refuter proveth the firſt of the three former reaſons by divers arguments. The firſt <note place="margin">Sect. 2. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fut. p. 3. Def. p. 3.</note> whereof is as he ſayth, this; <hi>The doctrine of his ſermon is vtterly falſe, becauſe it is repugnant to the truth, the word of truth, the ſcripture of truth.</hi> now, what ſayth he to it? 1. he calleth <hi>them all ridiculous amplificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> 2. he ſayth <hi>his Ref. had rather take it for granted, then be putt to prove is to be repugnant to the word; and 3. that he for his parte ſhall make it cleare in this defence, that there is not a ſillable in the ſcriptuere to prove the pretended diſcipline, and that the epiſcopall function hath good warrant in the word.</hi> To all which I have not much to reply. To the firſt, not to ſtand upon the number of the amplifications, we ſee, the ſentences are there onely, and minde one thing, the ſecond being an expoſition of the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:14068:14"/> firſt, the third, of the ſecond, the one adding not an exegeſis one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but an <hi>emphaſis</hi> alſo to the other. But ſay they are more then needed; is it not much more then needeth to call them <hi>ridiculous?</hi> Wiſdome, I perceive, muſt dye with the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>putt caſe there were ſuch an amplification in the Service book, as <hi>ridiculous</hi> as it is, the D. I doubt not, would find a hand to ſubſcribe it, as agreable to the word of God, and no doubt but might doe it with more peace of conſcience, then to many amplifications therein conteyned; &amp; yet no ridiculous thing in Gods ſervice is agreable to Gods word. To the ſecond; may I aſk the Doct what need the refuter had to prove that in his praeface, which the whole refutation tendeth to prove; and whither it was not enough for him in it to admoniſh thereof? And me thinkes he anſwereth it in the third part by his own prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, when he ſayth, <hi>he ſhall make all cleare in his book &amp;c.</hi> the which how well he hath performed, wil appeare in the examination of the particulars, in the meane time, it ſeemeth his ſermon made not all cleare.</p>
                     <p>So much for the firſt argument. A ſecond the Doct frameth of the Ref: words thus. <hi>The doctrine is vtterly falſe; becauſe it is contrary to the judgement &amp; practiſe of the primitive Churches, next after Chriſt and his Apoſtles.</hi> To let paſſe the wrong he offreth herein to his Refut. <note place="margin">The D. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine wrog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Ref. in making more arg. of his Ref. words then he ment.</note> in making it by it ſelf an argument contrary to his meaning, let us heare his anſwere to it: <hi>I cannot tel</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>whether to wonder at more, the blindnes or the impudencie of the man.</hi> And why ſo? <hi>becauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I have made it manifeſt, that the government of the Church by Biſhops hath the ful conſent of antiquity, and not one testimonie of the auncient writers, for their iudgement, or one example of the primitive Churches, for their prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe to be alleadged to the contrarie.</hi> &amp;c. I am ſory I ſhall trouble the D. with ſo many queſtions: where I pray, hath he made this ſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt? in his ſermon or in the defence of it? hath not the refuters as much (if not more) reaſon to wonder, at the D. blindnes and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudencie? ſeing, if he made it cleare in his ſermon, is he not blind, in not ſeing that he hath made this his own defence needleſſe? is it not his owne argument, <hi>that things manifeſt need not be disputed, nothing needeth to be argued or disputed, but that which is not evident?</hi> But his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive <note place="margin">The D. practyce co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicteth his ſpeach.</note> travell in mainteyning that ſermon, and the ſtrange fitts he falleth into, in his defence thereof doe ſhew, that in his ſermon he made not the matter ſo cleare as he talketh of. Where then? in his
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:14068:14"/> defence? ſo it ſeemeth, he meaneth. And be it ſo, yet was it not ſo before (no not in his owne eyes) for then this defence, by his owne reaſon had been needleſſe. What reaſon then, hath he, to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue his refuter eyther of wonderfull blindnes, for not ſeing that which was not then to be ſeene: or of impudencie, for affirming the contrary, which if he hath not clearely proved, is yet in quaeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. May we not rather wonder, and wonder in deed, at the Doct. that counteth it woderful ignorace or impudencie for any to deny or diſprove whatſoever he ſayth, &amp; ſeemeth to himſelf, manifeſtly to prove; though in ſaying as he ſayth here, he doth but crave the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? And yet out of the ſame paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he proceedeth &amp; aſketh his ref. <note place="margin">The D. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth him ſelf and the part in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</note> 
                        <hi>how he durſt mention the judgement and practiſe of the primitive Church for the triall of the truth in queſtion, ſeing there is not one teſtimonye nor example in all antiquity for the pretended diſcipline &amp;c:</hi> and offreth, <hi>that if his Ref. ſhall bring any one pregnant teſtimony or example, he will yeeld in the whole cauſe.</hi> Not to tell him agayn, that he is ſtill in begging the queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: I praye him to tell his Ref. what ſhould feare him from mentioning that, which he vndertook to juſtify and proove? and whereto his large defenſe ſerveth, if his Ref. hath not at leaſt in ſhewe proved as much as he mencioneth; or not brought ſo much as one teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or example to the purpoſe? the D. in his paſſion forgatt himſelf and the point in queſtion ſurely; he could not els but knowe, that diverſe teſtimonies of the Fathers, are brought to prove the func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Biſhops in queſtion, to be jure humano, not divino. As for his offer <hi>to yeild in the whole cauſe, yf but any one pregnant teſtimony or example be produced:</hi> by <hi>pregnant</hi> he meaneth certeinly, ſuch as are ſubject to no wreſting, or cavillation; but pregnant in his owne judgment, not in the judgment of all, or the moſt ſound &amp; ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxall divines in the world; otherwiſe teſtimonies pregnant enough have bin already produced. But what ſo pregnant, that Cavillers, (ſuch eſpecially as have the ſword by their ſide) cannot with ſome colours or others elude, and thereby delude the eyes of the ſimple, which is all they care for.</p>
                     <p>In the next place, where the Ref: ſayth that his doctrine is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary <note place="margin">Sect. 3. pag. 4. of the ref. &amp; 4 of the Doct.</note> to <hi>the iudgement of all the reformed churches, ſince the reeſtabliſhment of the goſpel by the worthies in theſe latter times:</hi> the D. chargeth with an vntruth, ſaying. <hi>It is not a strange thing, that a man profeſſing ſincerity ſhould ſo overreache, ſeing a farre greater part of the reformed Churches, is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned

For may not reformed Churches be governed by Byſhops or Supreintendents, and yet the ſame Churches denie, that the calling of our L. Biſhops is jure divino? which is, (at leaſt as the Ref. vnderſtandeth it) the maine doctrine of the ſermon; and that whereto all other particulars doe homage and ſervice. When the D. hath proved, that the Biſhops and Superintendents of all reformed Churches, are ſuch (for the ſubſtance of their calling) as ours, and doe hold or exerciſe their functions, jure divino, &amp; not poſitivo; lett him charge his Refut. with <hi>overreaching.</hi> In the meane time he ſheweth himſelf too ready to overreach; for if he looke over his Biſhops and Superintendents mentioned in the later ende of his book, he maye ſee (if he ſhutt not his eies) that they held not their Biſhoprickes or Supreinte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Iodocus Naum vpon <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. diſtributeth the Church-officers ordeyned by GOD into <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> the <hi>Prophets</hi> into <hi>Pastors &amp; Teachers, the Deacons</hi> into <hi>treaſurers for the poore,</hi> and thoſe which are <hi>Preſbyters or Elders,</hi> viz. <hi>Orderers or moderators</hi> of diſcipline. Nicholaus Laurentius a late Superintendent in Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, in his treatiſe of excommunication publiſhed Anno 1610. hath theſe aſſerrions. That the right of excommunication, is not in the power of any one man, eyther Biſhop or Paſtor; but in the power of the Paſtors, &amp; that company which Paul calleth the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterie
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:14068:15"/> (p. 62.)

(ibid). Many moe might be brought for this purpoſe, (if it were fitting for this place) but theſe are enough to juſtify the refuters aſſertion, and to ſhewe the Doct. weaknes in ſo overreaching, as to charge that unjuſtly vpon his refuter, which he himſelf is juſtly guilty of.</p>

And herein we have againſt him (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt many others) the conſent of thoſe reverend Biſhops, who having ſayd that Chriſt gave none of his Apoſtles, nor any of their ſucceſſors, any ſuch authority as the Pope claymeth over Princes, or in civill matters, doe make application thereof aſwell to Preiſts as to Biſhops. But the D. notwithſtanding, upon this, (that the Biſhops are the Apoſtles ſucceſſors) goeth on and telleth us, <hi>That we may not inferre; becauſe the Apostles were equall among themſelves, that therfore they were not ſuperior to the 72 diſciples; or becauſe Biſhops are equall among themſelves, therefore they are not ſuperior to other Miniſters.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, I could ſay it is true; if it were apparant, firſt, that Biſhops &amp; other Miniſters doe differ by any ſpecial difference, as the 72. diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples did from the Apoſtles: but no ſuch thing appeareth, eyther in the ſcriptures, or in the Biſhops booke from whence the Doct. reaſoneth: but rather, as hath bene ſhewed by the refuter, (and is before mainteyned) the cleane contrary. Secondly, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles had any ſuperiority over theſe diſciples, the which the Doctor wil not ſo eaſily prove as take for granted; ſeing 1. Chriſt living, the Apoſtles had no authority over any, 2. their Apoſtolical authority was not as then (whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the 72. were ſent forth) co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted vnto them. and 3. it appeareth not that the Miniſtery of the 72. was to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the Church after Chriſt; but onely to remaine for that
<pb facs="tcp:14068:18"/> preſent journey and afterwards to be diſpoſed of as Chriſt pleaſed. Thirdly it is alſo true, that as the equality of the Apoſtles amonge themſelves, and the ſuppoſed ſuperioritie they had over the 72, tooke not away their ſubjection and inferiority to Chriſt: ſo ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth the equallity of Biſhops among themſelves, nor their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perioty over other Miniſters take away their inferiority to the Pope, by any neceſſity of conſequence. Wherefore I muſt for this <note place="margin">The Refus. rightly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</note> teſtimony conclude, 1. that the refuter hath rightly alleadged it; and 2. that the D. hath wronged not onely his refuter: but us &amp; them, in labouring (and that with ſlaunder,) to wreſt their teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony out of our hands.</p>

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:14068:21"/> hence ariſeth this ſecond notorious vntruth; but how doth M. D. make it appeare ſo? 1. Can he deny, the doctrine in his ſermon to be cleane contrary to their judgement that holde the government our Biſhops exerciſe over other Miniſters to be given them jure hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mano, by the poſitive lawe of man onely? No he dareth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict his Refuter in this point. What then? 2. Doth he deny that the Papiſts doe pleade for their hierarchy with the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that he doth for ours? no, he onely indeavoureth to perſwade, that his arguments are good, though theirs be naught. 3. But doe not our worthy wryters (thoſe the refuter named with others) in their anſwers to the Papiſts that alleadge the ſame reaſons, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine (as the refuter ſaith, that the governme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t which our Biſhops exerciſe over other Miniſters, is jure humano, not by divine right but) by the poſitive lawe of man onely? This is ſo evident a truth, that the D. neyther doth nor can refell it. Where then is that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious vntruth, wherewith he chargeth his Refuter by reaſon of thoſe wordes? is not he rather a notorious ſlaunderer in delivering <note place="margin">The D. is the ſlau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer.</note> ſuch an accuſation as he cannot juſtify? Iudge Chriſtian reader whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou haſt heard his anſwer. <hi>Firſt, ſayth he, the popiſh opinion is farre dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from that, which I hold; for they holde the order and ſuperiority of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops to be jure divino, implying thereby a perpetuall neceſſity therof; in ſo much that where Biſhops are not to ordeyne, they think there can be no Miniſters nor Preiſts, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequently no Church: I holde otherwiſe as the Ref: himſelf acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth, p. 90 in fine. If therefore the Papiſts doe bringe the like argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts to prove their opinion which is ſo unlike to mine; nothing hindreth but my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments may be good, though theirs be naught. For thoſe argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtratively prove the epiſcopall function to be of Apostolical institution, doe not ſtraitewayes prove it to be divini juris. Wherefore my opinion being ſo farr different from the popiſh conceite; who ſeeth not that the judgement of our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, which is oppoſed to the doctrine of the Papists, is not oppoſue to mine? for though they hold not the epiſcopal function to be injoyned jure divino, as being perpetually neceſſary; yet what man of ſound learning doth or dare deny that the firſt Biſhops were ordeyned by the Apoſtles?</hi> Thus we ſee how the D. hath ledd us along. But notwithſtanding the confidence of his ſpeach, obſerve wee the extreame povertie of his cauſe; is he not neere driven, (think ye) when to prove his great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene his opinion and the Papiſts, he is fayne to flye to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futers acknowledgment of it in that 90. page, where with the ſame
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:14068:22"/> breath, he challengeth him to be contrary to himſelfe, ſeeminge at leaſt to vnſay that in one place, which he had ſayd in another? Doth he not remember that he hath often charged his refuter to affirme throughout his anſwere that he holdeth the epiſcopal fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to be <hi>iure divino,</hi> and to imply a perpetuall neceſſity thereof? how then doth the refuters acknowledgement prove that the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh opinion is farre different from his? Doth it not rather prove that in this very point wherein he layeth the mayne difference, he he is fully knitt vnto them? although forgetting himſelfe (as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Papiſts alſo do in their diſcourſes) he contradicteth at one time, what he maynteyneth at an other. But to let the world ſee, how he jumpeth wth the Papiſts in this matter, I wil relate his opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; (not in his ref: words, but in his owne). <hi>The functio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; authority</hi> (ſaith he, ſerm. p. 79) <hi>which Tim. and T it. had at Epheſus and in Crete (co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſisting speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the power of ordinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; juriſdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) was not to end with their perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, but to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued in their ſucceſſors, as being ordinary &amp; perpetually neceſſary, not onely for the wel-being, but alſo for the very being of the Churches. For if whiles the Apoſtles themſelves lived, it was neceſſary that they ſhould ſubſtitute in the Churches already planted, ſuch as Timothy and Titus furniſhed with epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal power: then much more after their deceaſe, have the Churches need of ſuch governours.</hi> Loe here his owne wordes: now who ſeeth not that they cloſely implye, that which he ſaith, the Papiſts doe more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently <note place="margin">The D. cloſely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth, what the Papiſts im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently affirme.</note> affirme? viz, that where Biſhops are not to ordeyne, there can be no Miniſters or Preiſts, and conſequently no Church. Yet there is a freind of the Do. who pleadinge the ſame cauſe bluſheth not (among other propoſitions, delivered to diſgace the Preſbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian diſcipline, and the mainteyners thereof) to affirme in playne termes that, <hi>all Miniſters created and made by the newe Preſbyterie, are mere laye-perſons, and cannot lawfully, eyther preach Gods word, or admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the ſacraments;</hi> ſo ſaith Tho: Bell in his regiment of the Church, page 136: and then addeth, <hi>this is already proved:</hi> and a little afer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth with Ieroms wordes (often objected by the Papiſts againſt the Proteſtants) <hi>eccleſia non eſt quae non habet ſacerdotem; where there it no Preiſt or Minister there can be no Church.</hi> But to returne to the D. ſeing all the reaſon he here bringeth to mainteyne his accuſation is from the difference of opinion betwixt the Papiſts and him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the authority of Biſhops: it being made evident that there is no ſuch difference as he pretendeth, it will neceſſarily followe
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:14068:22"/> that this ſecond vntruth how notorious ſoever, here charged upon his refuter, muſt be diſcharged upon himſelfe. For it is a truth (ſo <note place="margin">The 2. vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth which the D. char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth upon the Ref. returneth to himſelf.</note> evident, as the D. cannot deny it), that the judgement of our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines is wholly oppoſite to his, in that they hold the calling of L. Biſhops to be, neyther divini nor apoſtolici juris, neither as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, nor as the D. holdeth them, if he did (as he ſayth) ſo farre differ from them. And putt caſe, the difference betwixt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts and him were ſuch as he ſaith; yet what is that to the point in queſtion? (I meane to prove the refuters aſſertio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be a notorious vntruth?) nothing at all. The D. in deed <hi>his opinion being ſo different (as he fayth) from the popiſh conceit,</hi> asketh who <hi>it is that ſeeth not that the judgement of our divines oppoſed to the doctrine of the Papiſts is not oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to his:</hi> and I may ask him, what meant he to ask that queſtion? Maye not the D, (yea doth he not) agree with the Papiſts in affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minge the epiſcopal function to be divini juris; thereby intending that it is a divine and not an humane ordinance; though he ſhould differ from them in the point of the perpetual and immutable ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of the function? And may not our worthy writers of whome the Refuter ſpeaketh, (yea can the Doctor ſhewe that they doe not) contradict the papiſts aſwell in the former point, as in the later? Will he ſay, (and can he prove) that they determine ſuch Biſhops onely as have ſuch a calling as the papiſts mainteyne to be jure humano, by the poſitive lawe of man onely? doe they not generally conclude and determine the matter, of all Biſhops what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, that are ſuperior to other Miniſters? or can they holde (which the Ref. ſaith they doe, and the D. doth not denie) that the government our Biſhops exerciſe over other Miniſters is jure humano onely, and yet hold it an apoſtolicall ordinance alſo? or can they hold, that ſo farre forth as there is a perpetuall neceſſity thereof, it is onely jure humano: and that ſo farre forth as it is not perpetuall, but ſo as the Church may be a church without it; it is an apoſtolicall and a divine ordinance? Or doe our writers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore determine againſt the papiſts, that the government aforeſaid is onely <hi>jure humano,</hi> becauſe they defend it to be perpetually neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary? Or doe they determine onely againſt thoſe reaſons of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts by which they prove this government to be perpetually ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary? Will the D. affirme this? Is not the contrary to all this moſt evident to them that read their writings? Doe they not plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:14068:23"/> and directly without any relation to this or that conceite, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude againſt all thoſe reaſons which papiſts bring, that the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Biſhops over other Miniſters, is not an ordinance divine or apoſtolicall, but humane onely, directly contrary to the D. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, lett his reaſons be what they be may? And it were worth the knowinge what reaſons thoſe are that demonſtratively prove (as he ſaith) the epiſcopall function to be of apoſtolicall inſtitution, &amp; yet prove it not to be divini juris, and of perpetuall neceſſitie: as alſo what worthy writers of our ſide againſt the papiſts there are, that mainteyninge the epiſcopall function to be of apoſtolicall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, doe yet deny it to be divini juris and perpetually neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? not that great Bell of whome we heard even nowe, I am ſure of. For as for the D. ſilly diſtinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> betwene <hi>apostolical inſtuutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; divine right,</hi> whereby he putteth this difference betwixt his opinion &amp; the papiſts, as he telleth not from whence it commeth; ſo I ſee not whither it goeth; except to give Romiſh licence to alter and change divine ordinances, at humane pleaſures. But hereof more hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in a ſitter place, here enough is ſaid for the Ref. defence againſt the D. ſecond ſlander; wherin he hath bewraied want both of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and honeſty: the one in devyſing ſuch ſilly ſhifts, and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">The D. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wraieth want of judgment &amp; honeſty.</note> to eſcape fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the whole hoſt of our worthy writers by putting on ſo poore a viſard, or peece of a garment that would ſcarce cover any part of him: the other in labouring againſt the truth and his own conſcience, to perſwade that none of our worthy Champions againſt the papiſts are in their judgment oppoſite to him in this queſtion. And this his fault is the greater, becauſe he laieth downe their judgement imperfectly; and cloſely ſtealeth all reputation <note place="margin">The D. wrongeth all our beſt divines</note> of ſound learninge, both from them, and all other that accorde in judgment with them. The former appeareth in that he reſtrei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth their deniall of the epiſcopall function to be divini juris, vnto his owne ſenſe, as if thereby they ment nothing elſe; then that their functio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is not perpetually neceſſarie; whereas it is plaine, they make it an humane and not a divine ordinance. The later diſcovereth it ſelf, in that he aſketh <hi>what man of ſound learning; doth or can deny, but that the firſt Biſhops were ordeyned by the Apoſtles?</hi> For he cannot be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, that (as our immediate forefathers before ſpoken of, ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo) the greateſt nomber of orthodoxall divines at this day do flatly deny, that the ſuperioritie of Biſhops over other Miniſters was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned

But how proveth the D. that the Refuter hath in theſe words vttered a notorious vntruth? for that is the charge; if many words will prove it, he hath proved it in deed, for he hath ſpent a page and halfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, wherein is as much profoundnes, as truth; let vs give him the hearing at large. Before he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to the reſtimonies quoted by the refuter, he giveth us two diſtinctions; one concerning the <hi>epiſcopal power,</hi> the other concerning the <hi>exerciſe thereof;</hi> firſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the firſt. Touching <hi>their power,</hi> he telleth us, that it is either <hi>ſpirituall reſpecting the ſoul, as to binde and looſe the ſouls of men:</hi> or <hi>corporall reſpecting the outward man, as to binde and looſe the bodies; the former of which is derived to them from the Apoſtles; the later committed to them by the King; to whoſe crowne all commanding and compulſive power is annexed.</hi> It is well he graunteth the civil power of Biſhops to be jure humano, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie is much beholden to him. But will he ever be able to prove (trow we) that the ſpirituall power of <hi>opening &amp; ſhutting, binding</hi> and <hi>looſing,</hi> which he ſaith was derived to the Biſhops from the Apoſtles, is by divine ordinance proper to them, and not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to all Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the goſpell with them, but that they by the word of God are excluded from it? this he meaneth in and by thoſe wordes, or <note place="margin">The Doct. beggeth the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> elſe he ſpeaketh idlye; &amp; in ſo meaning, who ſeeth not that he beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the mayne queſtion, and laboureth for that, which by all the ſweat of his browes, he will never compaſſe?</p>
                     <p>Touching the <hi>exerciſe</hi> of their <hi>power,</hi> (to let paſſe his termes of <hi>babituall</hi> or <hi>potentiall right</hi> as fitter to choake then to nouriſh) his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, <hi>that though their power be derived to them from the Apoſtles as a divine ordinance: yet where a Christian Prince is aſſiſting and directinge

                           </gap>es eccleſiaſticall;</hi> ſeemeth to me ſomewhat harſh. 1. that God ſhould give to Archbiſhops, Biſhops &amp;c. ſuch a peereleſſe power, ſo <note place="margin">The Doct. ſpeaketh harſhly &amp; with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to himſelf.</note> abſolute and large over millions of ſoules, (as he ſpeaketh) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out certaine rules and directions for the exerciſing and managinge thereof; but hath left it as a dead trunke or body, to depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the eccleſiaſtical lawes of Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Princes, which as a ſoule, muſt give life and breath and motion thereunto. Verely that power is not a peereleſſe, but a powerleſſe power in deed. 2. That that power which hath rule and direction enough from God for the exerciſe of it, where no Chriſtian ayding and directing Princes, are, ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come powerleſſe and liveleſſe, by the aidance and adviſe of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Princes. 3. That the Doctor dare be ſo bold as (beſides theſe two) to imply (for ſo he doth) that Arch Biſhops and Biſhops with their adherence maie actually exerciſe their power, ſuppoſed to be derived to them from the Apoſtles, contrary to the eccleſiaſticall lawes, in caſe they be not ſuch as doe aſſiſte and direct them. But paſſe we on, all this winde ſhaketh no corne, nor maketh ought to prove the <hi>vntruth</hi> in queſtion: leave we therefore his diſtinctions, &amp; come we to his anſwere to the ref: firſt proof of his aſſertion. He affirmeth that <hi>the authority, which the reverend Iudge speaketh of in the place quoted, is the authority of the high Commiſſion, which the Biſhops exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe not as they are Biſhops (for that others who are no Biſhops have the ſame) but as they are the Kings commiſſioners eccleſiasticall;</hi> then which, <note place="margin">The D. ſpeaketh vntruly or deceiptful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> what can be more untruly or deceytfully ſpoken? Will he ſay that that reverend Iudge ſpeaketh of the authority of the high Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion onely? knoweth he not that that whole booke tendeth to prove, that both the function of Archbiſhops and L. Biſhops &amp; the juriſdiction they exerciſed in England, long before the high Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion was dreamt of, was by &amp; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Kings of England? Doth he not (pa. 13.) affirme (from the Statute of the Parliament held at Carliel 25. Edw. 1.) that the holy Church of England was founded in the ſtare of Prelacie by the King and his progenitors? And that in the time of Edw. the third, it was often reſolved (17. cap. 23.) that the K. might exempt any perſon from the juriſdiction of the Ordinarie, and graunt him epiſcopal juriſdiction? &amp; (fol. 9: edit. 1606) that (in 1. Hen. 4.) the Archbiſhops &amp; Biſhops of this Realme are called the K. ſpirituall Indges? And to conclude, doth he not
<pb facs="tcp:14068:24"/> afterwards conclude that though the proceedings and progreſſe of the eccleſiaſtical Courts run in the Biſhops name; yet both their courts &amp; lawes whereby they proceed, are the Kings? Verily, if by our lawes, their function and juriſdiction were holden to be of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ordinance, he neyther could nor would have ſaid ſo. But heare we the Doctor ſpeake againe, he telleth vs, <hi>that the authority which the Biſhops exerciſe in the high Comiſſion, is not exerciſed by them as they are Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops; but as they are high co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſioners,</hi> and his reaſon for it, is, <hi>for that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that are no Biſhops have the ſame.</hi> Wherein he dealeth as decitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">The. D. dealeth deceiptful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> as before. For 1. he will not (I ſuppoſe) avouch that the eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical juriſdiction which the Biſhops there exerciſe of ſuſpending exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municating depriving, &amp;c. is exerciſed as Commiſſioners and not as Biſhops and Archbiſhops? or that others their Aſſiſtants in that Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion, that are neyther Archbiſhops, Biſhops, nor Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the word, can without them exerciſe thoſe Cenſures? In deed, in that the high Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſioners convent men from all parts &amp; out of all Dioceſes in the Land, and proceed againſt them by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonments impoſitions of fines &amp;c. it is done by power of the high co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion: but for all eccleſiaſticall Cenſures, what doe they, which every Archbiſhop within his Province, and Biſhop within his Dioceſe may not doe, (yea ſometimes and too often doth not) without that Commiſſion? Thus we ſee how he hath infringed the Refuters firſt proofe, taken from Sr Edw. Cooks teſtimony or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. The refuter might have ſent him for further proofe of that point to that Booke called an <hi>Aſſertion for Church polocie;</hi> wherein are proofs plentifull and pregnant, whereof the D. in likelihood can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ignorant. And I might here commend vnto him other te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies alſo; but I haſt on to other more needfull matters.</p>
                     <p>Let us therefore heare him what he can ſay to his refuters ſecond proofe, to witt, the K. Majeſties judgement, whoſe words are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſet downe. 1. ſaith he, <hi>It ſeemeth that whiles the Refut: talketh of</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:14068:25"/> here falleth up to the eares into the pitt he digged for his refuter: and his fault is the greater, for that he cleareth his refuter of the crime objected, &amp; confirmeth him in his ſo judging, by the Kings words, which himſelfe layeth downe with the next breath ſaying. <hi>The King in deed doth ſay, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

We muſt therefore here leave the Doct. or follow him flying from the point in queſtion: for not daring to ſpeake one word to it, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealeth to the Kings wordes elſwhere, ſett downe (Premonition p. 44) from whence (if we will beleeve him) he will make it appeare, that the K. differeth not in judgement fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the doctrine of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. <hi>The Kings words are theſe, That Biſhops ought to be in the Church, I ever mainteyned as an apoſtolik inſtitution, and ſo the ordinance of God &amp;c:</hi> If the D. would by theſe the Kings words have proved the point in queſtion; he ſhould have ſhewed that the function of the Biſhops of the Church of England nowe exerciſed by them, is (for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of it) mainteyned by theſe words of the King, to be an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolik inſtitution and ſo the ordinance of God: the which if he could have done, he mought have made a contradiction betwene the Kings preface &amp; his Premonition; but never a whitt the more have proved that the King agreeth in judgement with the doctrine of his ſermon, which tendeth to prove another manner of epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal function to be of divine inſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> then the King in theſe words ſpeaketh of; as the Doct. (it ſeemeth) ſawe well enough, when he forbore to ſet downe his Majeſties very next words, where he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in what reſpect he ever held that epiſcopal function (which he ſpeaketh of) to be an Apoſtolike inſtitution: to witt, <hi>that he ever
<pb facs="tcp:14068:25"/> mainteyned the ſtate of Biſhops, and the eceleſiaſticall hierarchie, for order ſake. Againe, that he alloweth of Biſhops and Church hierarchy, and reverenceth the inſtitution of rankes and degrees among Biſhops, Patriarchs, (which he knoweth were in the tyme of the primitive Church) for order ſake.</hi> Againe, <hi>that if it were now a queſtion as once it was, which of the Patriarchs ſhould have the firſt place, he could with all his hare yeeld it to the Biſhop of Rome, that he ſhould be primus epiſcopus inter omnes epiſcopos, &amp; princeps epiſcopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, ſo it be no otherwiſe, but as Peter was princeps Apostolorum.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine affirmeth, <hi>that the allowance he giveth to the hierarchy of the church is for diſtinction of orders, for ſo he vnderstandeth it &amp;c.</hi> What ſhall we ſay to the Doctor? did he not read theſe ſpeaches of the King? or did he skip them, becauſe they ſpell not well for his purpoſe? It appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth plainely by them, that the other his Majeſties words cited by the Doctor, are without colour drawne by him, to juſtify that juriſdiction of Biſhops, for which he pleadeth. Who ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not that theſe his highnes wordes do evidently ſhewe, that he giveth no other juriſdiction to Biſhops over Preſbyters (by apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall inſtitution) then vnto Archbiſhops over Biſhops, and to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarches over Archbiſhops? And the ſame is not any ſole power of rule, but, for order ſake, ſuch a principallity as three of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles had over the reſt, and Peter had above the eleven: as is further to be obſerved out of page 48. where we may eaſily diſcerne, that it cannot be the Kings meaning to give vnto Peter ſuch juriſdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> over the Apoſtles, as our Biſhops have over Presbyters: nor yet to clippe the wings of his own ſupremacie, which he muſt needs doe, if that ſuperiority of order which he giveth to Patriaches above Archbiſhops, ſhall drawe with it, that power of rule, which our Archbiſhops and Biſhops have and exerciſe in their Courts.</p>
                     <p>Thus much may ſuffice to free the Refuter, from the third vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth, falſely fathered on him by the Doct. The reſt of his ſpeaches may well be paſſed over as impertinent; for however he ſayth, he herein co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to the point: yet as he therin toucheth not the point in queſtion; ſo he diſcovereth his owne vnſaying what he ſayd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in his ſermon, touching the perpetuity of the epiſcopal functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <note place="margin">The D. vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaieth in his Def. what he ſaid in his ſermon.</note> And were it fitt to followe him in his wandring fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the point in hand, it were no hard matter to ſhewe that himſelfe and others of his ſide have their hands cheife in the treſpaſſe, which he cloſely chargeth his Refut: and the men of his ſide with.

What defence, trowe we, will he make for that his reverend father, that gave him ſo good ſatiſfaction concerning the epiſcopall function, who diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth his judgement by the title of his booke <hi>The perpetuall gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſts Church?</hi> And if we adviſedly weigh what he affirmeth in the treatiſe it ſelfe (page 3. lin. 9.-12 and compare togither, p. 106. lin. 32. &amp;c. page 2, &amp; 3. lin. 12. with page 245. lin. 4. &amp; 9. &amp; 247. lin. 32-35.) we may eaſily diſcern, that he placeth a maine neceſſity in the reteyning of the epiſcopall function. Yea and ſo doth the D. alſo, (as his words already ſett downe doe ſhewe). Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can he with all his ſhifting, avoid the force of the objection, which from thoſe wordes his Refuter inforceth, as ſhalbe ſhewed more at large in a place more fit for the purpoſe.

And yet in a matter of farre leſſe moment (to witt, the maintenance of our Clergie by tithes and other temporalities) he feareth not to taxe the King, and the

I ſaye malicious, and if his conſcience be ſpurred the quaeſtion, from the abundance whereof his pen wrote, it will ſubſcribe to it.

And hath he not ſlipped them over with ſuch a ſlubber, that (if he be not farre ſpent) he cannot laye them and his anſwere to them togither, without the bluſhredd-colour.

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be in all our Churches? But let vs examine his allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions apart. The firſt is the booke of Articles, and what doth that? <hi>The 36. article thereof approveth (ſaith he) the booke of conſecrating Biſhops Preiſts and Deacons.</hi> And what then? <hi>that booke</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face thereof ſaith, that from the Apoſtles times there have bene thoſe orders of Ministers Biſhops Preiſts and Deacons in Chriſts Church, and that God by his spirit appointed them in his Church.</hi> Is not this a ſweet proof? mark it well, <hi>The articles approve the booke, and the preface of that booke ſaith, that thoſe three orders have bene in the Church from the Apostles times &amp;c. Therefore the booke of articles (and conſequently the doctrine of the church of England) approveth the function of Biſhops and their ſuperiority above Preists to be of divine ordinance.</hi> As if 1. what ſoever is ſayd in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face before the booke (which in all likelihood was done by one or two onely, and not by ſo generall a conſent as the booke it ſelfe) muſt needs be allowed for the currant doctrine of the Church of England in that age, becauſe the 36. article (in our booke of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles) doth for ſome purpoſe approve the booke of conſecrating Biſhops &amp;c. as conteyning in it all things neceſſary to ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration. But 2. doth that preface ſay that thoſe 3. orders were in the Apoſtles times? no, but from the Apoſtles times, excluſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; which words do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Oecum:) in his anſwere page 87. in the like phraſe of Ierom to Evagrius, ſaying, that from Mark the Evangeliſt unto Heraclas &amp;c. one of the Presbyters were choſen from amongſt the reſt &amp; ſet over the reſt &amp;c. But 3. it ſeemeth they meant otherwiſe, by the laſt clauſe, which the D. citeth, <hi>that God by his spirit appointed them in his Church.</hi> But the reader muſt know that that ſentence is none of theirs, nor to be found in that preface, it hath pleaſed the D. <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> to add that clauſe of his owne head, and cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their meaning that made that book at leaſt: for as we have heard (cap. 3, before going,) they held the ſuperiority of Biſhops, <note place="margin">The D. ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth one ſentence, to his teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and detracteth another from it.</note> to be a politick deviſe of man, and not the ordinance of God. Let us goe forwards with the Doct: he addeth, <hi>that the Biſhop is required to correct and puniſh according to ſuch authority as he hath by Gods word.</hi> Here 1. I charge the D, as before with the adding of one ſentence, ſo here with the detracting of another whiles he deceitfully co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:14068:29"/> part of the words. For the booke requireth the Biſhop to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and puniſh &amp;c. <hi>according to ſuch authority, as he hath by Gods word and the ordinance of this realme:</hi> which later clauſe <hi>(of the lawes of this realme)</hi> they would never have added, had they thought that the power which our Biſhops exerciſe is wholly by Gods word. But 2. though thoſe words detracted by the Doctor had not bene ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by them; if he thinketh it wil prove that the function now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed by Biſhops is warranted to them by Gods word; he forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his owne diſtinction betweene <hi>poteſt as &amp; modus poteſtatis,</hi> togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the difference which he putteth betweene function and authoritie lib. 4. pag. 100, 102. &amp; 147. Neyther 3. is that autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which the booke requireth Biſhops to exerciſe, ſuch a ſole power of correction, as the Doctor giveth unto them; for the ſame booke requireth alſo of every Miniſter (aſwell as of the Biſhop) at his ordination, <hi>that he preach the word, and adminiſter the ſacraments &amp;</hi>

                        <hi>diſcipline;</hi> ſo giving every Miniſter a ſtroke in the outward policie &amp; government of the Church, (aſwel as the Biſhop) which the Doct. taketh quite from him. But to conclude this point, the booke of articles, doth in deed, ſhewe the judgement of our Church in ſome matters of policie and church government deviſed by men, aſwell as in more weighty points of faith ſet down in Gods word. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the doctrine of our Church concerning the later, is not to be ſought for, in the booke of conſecration, or the 36. article that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſheth it, (much leſſe in the preface of that booke) but rather in thoſe articles which concerne faith and ſacraments. For the whole body of our Church being aſſembled in Parliament, evidently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that there were ſome clauſes ſentences and articles in that booke and the preface thereof not warrantable by the word; did therefore approve of it, no further, then it concerned the doctrine of faith and ſacraments; and provided alſo that no Miniſter of the word, ſhould be tied by his ſubſcription further to approve it: as well appeareth by the ſtatute. 13. Elizab: cap. 12. And here I wiſh the reader 1. to take notice, that in all that booke, there is no word of Archbiſhops, Archdeacons, Deanes, rurall Deanes with the reſt of that rowe; ſo that they will not be found (be like) in the word; nor hath God by his ſpirit appointed them in his Church. 2. To ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, how the Doct. that ſo boldly and confidently (that I ſay no more) rejecteth ſo many Synods, Churches, and learned men al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:14068:30"/> by the Refut: and acknowledged by himſelf to be ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxal divines, is not ſo wel ſeene in his allegation here, as he would ſeeme to be; ſurely he mought very well conceive, that we might take exception not onely to his booke of ordering Biſhops, Preiſts and Deacons; but to the article that eſtabliſheth it, both being made by the Biſhops themſelves, Iudges in their owne cauſe, and ſeeking their owne preheminence; eſpetially when they were both ſo farre excepted againſt, by that whole aſſembly of Parliament, as not to binde any by ſubſcription to approve them, ſo much as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to the word.</p>

Perhaps he ment to juſtify (at leaſt it well appeareth he hath juſtifyed) his ref. in charging him, to have given the papiſts much advantage: for is it not a great advantage vnto them, when they may (if they liſte) aſſume the Doctors teſtimonie, to diſgrace thoſe worthy divines, which in other reformed Churches have abandoned the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and government controverted in our Churches, with depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting (and that in a newe fangled and factious humor, and of meere hatred to their perſons) from that ancient government, and thoſe lawfull ceremonies, which they received from the doctrine and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the primitive Church? But it ſeemeth he forgatt that of Tully, verecundius loquor propter Pompeium; For however he vilifieth his refuter without bluſhing, taking him to be no better then a diſhclout: yet conſidering he had ſo many Pompeies to deale with as his refuter mentioneth, he could not but harden his face as an Adamant, that he bluſheth not (notwithſtanding their names with their teſtimonies and arguments and their juſt praiſes given them by other learned more then by the refuter) to count all newe fangliſme and faction.</p>

But the Doctor muſt beare it, and it will ſtick cloſe to his ribbs, till he can remove the reaſon that inforceth it vpon him. To witt, <hi>that his doctrine tendeth to the upholding of the popiſh hierarchy aſwell as ours, and therefore is Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian.</hi> The conſequence he impugneth not; all his labour is to weaken the Antecedent. And firſt in the deteſtation thereof, he cryeth out, <hi>God forbid;</hi> which brought to my minde the ſaying of Hazael, 2.

A poore ſhifte <note place="margin">The Doct. hath a poore ſhift and a ſilly defence.</note> and a ſilly defence. Could the Doctor be ſo ſimple as to imagine that his refuter had any meaninge to charge him or his doctrine with vpholding the popiſh Hierarchie in any of thoſe maine diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, which here or afterwards, he mentioneth, to diſtinguiſh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from our Clergie?

                     <p>
                        <hi>My doctrine tendeth not to vpholde the popiſh hierarchy, quatenus it is properly Antichriſtian.

Which is a truth ſo apparant, that the Doctor doth in part cloſely acknowledge it, though with <note place="margin">The Doct. cloſely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what he fairely, but falſely excuſeth.</note> a faire (but falſe) pretence, he ſeeketh to excuſe it, when he ſayth, <hi>wee are content to obſerve the auncient government of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church, though reteyned by them:</hi> for what is that governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wherein we agree with them? Is it not the government by ARCH BISHOPS, LORD BISHOPS, ARCH DEACONS, CHANCELLORS, COMMISSARIES, &amp;c. aſſiſted with Proctors and Apparators? Wherefore ſince the functions of the popiſh hierarchy ſerving for CHVRCH-government, are none other
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:14068:34"/> then ſuch as we reteyne in our Churches (the Pope and his Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals excepted) the D. cannot diſclaime the defence, of the reſt of their hierarchy, vnleſſe he will leave our owne naked and deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of due protection. And if that be true, which the refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hath in many parts of his anſwer obected, (viz that the Papiſts doe (and may with as good colour of truth, alleadge the ſame reaſons for the Popes primacie, over Archbiſhops, that the D. urgeth for the ſuperiorty of Biſhops or Archbiſhops) it is no wrong at all to affirme, that the D. ſermon tendeth to vphold the popiſh hierarchie, aſwell as ours, even from the Pope to the Apparitor. But let vs go on and trace the Doctor in the ſtepps of his anſwere. 1. Who can excuſe him in this, that profeſſing (as he now doth) the Pope to be properly Antichriſt, in regard of that vniverſall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment which he aſſumeth; he ſhould notwithſtanding reare vp a pillar (in his defenſe following) to upholde what he would ſeeme <note place="margin">The Doct. vpholdeth what he ſeemeth to pull down.</note> to pull downe. For to juſtify the government of Metropolitans (who were at the firſt as he ſaith, lib. 2. p. 114, <hi>autochephaloi,</hi> heads by themſelves of their Provinces) he thus reaſoneth, page follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>It was convenient or rather neceſſary that there ſhould be conſociation of Churches within the ſame Province, and that that governours of the ſeverall Dioceſes, ſhould meet for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon good, and that the wrongs offred to any by the Biſhops within their Dioceſes might be remedied. By conſequent, therefore it was neceſſarie (especially before there were Chriſtian Magistrates) that one in every Province, ſhould be held as cheefe or primate, who ſhould aſſemble the Synods, moderate them being aſſembled, ſee the decrees executed, &amp; have a generall ſuperintendencie over the whole province.</hi> By the like conſeq: (it is well knowne that) the Popes proctors doe plead for his vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall primacie; and the D. doth very frankly offer them the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent. lib. 3. p. 4. <hi>The whole Church (ſaith he) is governed by the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall conſociation of their governours for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon good, and the concurrence of them to an Occumenical Synode: For the whole Church being but one body, there ought to be a Chriſtian conſociation of the governours therof, for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good of the whole body.</hi> If there ought to be ſuch a conſociation of all Biſhops and governours of the whole Church; then there is no leſſe conveniencie, or rather neceſſity of this conſociation of the whole, then there is of the former in one Province. Wherefore the Doctor cannot forbid any freind of the papacie (in an imitation of his former argument) to inferre this concluſion. By conſequent,
<pb facs="tcp:14068:34"/> therefore, it is neceſſarie (ſpecially now that there is not a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Magiſtrate, to whoſe civil regiment, all (or the greateſt part of) Chriſtian Churches, are in ſubjection as formerly they were to the Romane Empire) that among the eccleſiaſtical governours of the whole Church, one ſhould be held as cheife to aſſemble and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate generall councels, to ſee the decrees executed, and ſo to haue a general ſuperintendencie over the whole Church.

                     <p>2. Shall we ſay alſo that the ſame reaſon which proveth the one, to be Antichriſtian, will prove the other to be Antichriſtian? Is it not proper to Chriſt to be the head of every particular Church, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel as of the whole? 1. Cor. 12, 27. 2 Cor. 11. 2.

                     <p>3. But I haſten to examine the grounds which he hath layd to <note place="margin">Sect. 5. ad D. pag. 13.</note> cleare himſelfe from patronizing the popiſh prelacie. He affirmeth (as we heard before) <hi>that their government is juſtly termed Antichristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, who are aſſistantes to the Pope in his vniverſal government.</hi> Loe here the propoſition, I wil make ſo holde, as to add an aſſumption. <hi>But Archbiſhops, L.

The negative in this queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſhould have ſtrongly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified; but he rather juſtifieth his Ref. aſſertion, in profering them a full diſcharge from all ſteine of Antichriſtianity, if they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce their ſubordination to the Pope, and acknowledgement of him for their head. But, ſeing he profeſſeth (lib. 3. pag. 154.) never to give over the maintena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of his cauſe; at his better leyſure I will expect from him a direct anſwere to this reply; <hi>I have already proved from his owne aſſertion, that their government is juſtly termed An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian:</hi> But <hi>their juriſdiction extended over the Churches of an whole Dioceſe or Province, is a principall and eſſentiall part of their government:</hi> why then <hi>ſhould not their juriſdiction ſo largely extended, be juſtly termed Antichriſtian?</hi> Againe, <hi>wherein ſoever they give beſt and greateſt aſſiſtance vnto the Pope in his vniverſall government; therein they are rightly reputed antichriſtian:</hi> this I truſt the D. will acknowledge without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proofe, neyther will he (I hope) putt us to the paines to prove what all the world diſcerneth to be true. viz. <hi>that in the large extent of their juriſdictions, they give beſt and greateſt aſſiſtance vnto the Pope in his
<pb facs="tcp:14068:35"/> vniverſall government;</hi> wherefore I will once reſt perſwaded, that he will ſubſcribe to this concluſion, that in <hi>respect of the large extent of their juriſdiction, they are justly reputed Antichristian.</hi> And ſo I will enter vpon the beſt defence he hath to wipe away all note of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtianity from our owne Biſhops.</p>
                     <p>Having reſtreyned (as before we heard) that Antichriſtianity <note place="margin">Section. 6.</note> which cleaveth to Romiſh Prelacie, <hi>vnto their ſubordination to the Pope &amp;c.</hi> he addeth this conſequence. <hi>Therefore they are no more Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, then their pariſh-Preists, and aſwell might the Refut. call the Paſtors of Pariſhes amongst us Antichriſtian, becauſe the Popiſh Pariſh Preiſts are Antichristian, as our Biſhops Antichriſtian, becauſe the Popiſh Biſhops</hi>

Where doth the Refut. ſaie, that our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops are Antichriſtian, becauſe the Popiſh are ſuch? Or which of his Oppoſites did ever argue to ſuch a purpoſe? Nay hath his Ref. in any part of his anſwere once termed our Biſhops Antichriſtian? Yet if he had ſayd, that the Popiſh be, and ours are alike Antichriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian in regard of their functions, as being in ſubſtance one and the ſame, however they differ in ſubordination to the Pope; he is wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet (I trowe) then to be ſo farre miſledd by the Doctor, as to ſay, that our pariſh paſtors, and their pariſh preiſts are alike antichriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian. For their Preiſthood (in regard of the very eſſence and forme of their office) is a ſacrificing preiſthood as the Doct. acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, and the proctors of poperie doe more clearely teach: Rhe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. annot. in Acts 14. 23. Bellarm. lib. de ſac. ord. cap. 9. But the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of our pariſh paſtors (though corruptly termed Preiſts) hath nothing to doe with ſacrificing, and therefore it is not the ſame of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, but of a diverſe forme, ordeyned (as the Doctor rightly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth) to preach the word and to adminiſter the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. Now there is no ſuch eſſentiall differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in the very function it ſelf, which our Biſhops and the popiſh doe holde and execute. Wherefore though it be an abſolute inconſequence, to inferre that our pariſh paſtors are Antichriſtian, becauſe the popiſh pariſh preiſts are ſuch: (in as much as the functions are differing) yet when the functions of our Biſhops and theirs are called into queſtion; if the later be granted Antichriſtian; the ſame muſt be confeſſed alſo of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; vnleſſe it can be clearely ſhewed, that the functions doe differ eſſentially one from another.</p>
                     <pb n="58" facs="tcp:14068:36"/>
                     <p>2. And if his meaning be thus to plead in behalfe of our Biſhops, viz, <hi>that they cannot be Antichriſtian, becauſe the popiſh Biſhops are not An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian in respect of the large extent of their juriſdiction, but in regard of their ſubordination to the Pope,</hi> &amp;c. I have already ſhewed the error of this argument, in proving that their very juriſdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; government is Antichriſtian. Onely here agayne let the reader remember, how the D. juſtifieth his Ref: in that ſpeach, wch he indevoureth to wipe away, viz. <hi>that he vpholdeth the Popiſh Hierarchy aſwell as our owne.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. In that which followeth, he aſſayeth to ſhewe, that the func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Biſhops was not firſt inſtituted by the Biſhops of Rome, &amp; therefore cannot be Antichriſtian. <hi>The function of Biſhops</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is not more (nor yet ſo much) to be aſcribed, to the institution of the Biſhop of Rome, as that of pariſh Miniſters: For Biſhops, as we ſhall ſhewe, were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned by the Apostles, and ſett over Dioceſes; but the pariſhes were firſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed in the Weſterne Churches, and Preſbyters peculiarly aſſigned to them, by the ancient Biſhops of Rome, whoſe example other Churches did imitate, as divers authors report.</hi> Is not the Doctor ſtrangely bewitched with the love of his reverend Fathers and their functions, that (to <note place="margin">The D. to free the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopall function from being reputed Antichriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth his owne cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace.</note> ſett them free from all feare of beinge any longer reputed Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian or of the Popes inſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) he will expoſe his owne calling and function to the ſame diſgrace? But if that be true, which diverſe authors report (as Platina in vita Euariſt: &amp; Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor Virgil: de invent rer: lib. 4. cap. 9. and others) that Euari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus did onely divide titles in the City of Rome vnto Preſbyters; and that Dyoniſius gave them Churches or Churchyardes, and diſtributed abroad aſwell Dioceſes to Biſhops, as Pariſhes to Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters: upon this ground we may ſafely affirme, that the function of Dioceſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Bps. is truely aſcribed to the inſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that monkiſh Pope Dioniſius, 266 yeares after Chriſt, or therabouts. For however Biſhops were ordeyned of the Apoſtles, and ſett over particular Churches, (as pariſh Miniſters are at this day) yet there could be no Dioceſan Biſhops till D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>oceſes were diſtributed, and pariſhes multiplyed in each Dioceſe. Wherefore it is neyther error nor blaſphemy to affirme, that the function of Dioceſan Biſhops is An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian; if that may be rightly termed Antichriſtian, which had the firſt inſtitution from the Biſhops of Rome, in the third centurie of yeares after Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>If the Doct. ſhall contradict this poſition it will eaſily be made
<pb facs="tcp:14068:36"/> good from the grounds of his owne manner of diſputing. For in <note place="margin">The Ref: juſtified, by the D. own grounds.</note> affirming (pag. 12. of his praeface) that the function and diſcipline of our Biſhops, though truely Catholike and Apoſtolicall, is of his oppoſites termed Antichriſtian; he offreth us this diſiunction. <hi>The functions and government of Dioceſan Biſhops and Provinciall Arch Biſhops are eyther truely Catholik and Apoſtolical, or elſe rightly termed an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian.</hi> He cannot weaken this diſiunctive propoſition, vnleſſe he will overthrowe his owne reaſoning, lib. 1. pag. 60. &amp; 61. and confeſſe himſelf to be as ignorant in logick, as he would make his refuter to be. If therefore it may appeare, that the functions and government of Dioceſan Biſhops, and Provincial Archbiſhops are not truely Catholike and Apoſticall, it wil then inevitably fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, that their functions &amp; goverme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t are juſtly termed Antichrſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> But the function and government of Dioceſan Biſhops, being firſt inſtituted by the Pope Dynoſius, cannot be truely Catholike or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolicall: much leſſe can the function and government of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall Archbiſhops, be truely catholik or apoſtolicall, if that be true which himſelf holdeth for a truth not to be denied, viz. that there were Dioceſan Biſhops ſuch as ours be, before there were any Metropolitans or Provinciall Primates; becauſe they followed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the combination of Dioceſes &amp; ſubordination of divers Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches togither with their Biſhops, in the ſame province, vnto the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitane as their Primate. lib. 3. p. 20 21. &amp; lib. 4. p. 7. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Doct. hath no juſt cauſe to blame his ref: if he ſhall hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hold the calling of Dioceſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; provincial Biſhops to be Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 4. Eſpecially ſeing he hath not at all touched the main grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds which prevayle with thoſe, who have affirmed the degrees &amp; functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Dioceſan Biſhops, &amp; Archb: to be Antichriſtian. viz. 1. that the bringing in of theſe degrees by litle and litle made way for the man of ſinne to climbe up to the top of his greatnes, &amp; to ſeat him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in that chaire of Luciferian pride, wherein he ſitteth at this day, as ſhalbe ſeene in the anſw: to his lib. 4. cap. 5. ſect. 10. 2. And as he ſtil leaneth on their ſhoulders, ſo his kingdome cannot ſtand with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them (for they are his aſſiſtants, &amp; without them they can have no preiſts, &amp; ſo no Church as the D. acknowledgeth pa: 7. &amp; 12. of of his preface) wheras on the contrary, the true Churches of Chriſt may (as the Doct. alſo holdeth as he ſayd before, page 2. and 7. of his preface) very well want them, as they did in the pureſt
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:14068:37"/> times (viz the firſt 200 yeares, as ſhall appeare in anſwere to his lib. 4. cap. 1. ſect. 4. and 5.) and doe in ſome places at this day flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in more peace and ſinceritie (witnes the broiles of the Church after the firſt 200. yeares, and the peace of the reformed Churches at this day) then thoſe Churches which formerly did and now doe imbrace them. 3. But ſpecially this is to be noted that ſole ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Biſhops (ſuch as are ours, dioceſan and provinciall Lords) (for which ſee the ſtate of the queſtion lib. 2. chap. 3. &amp; 4.) could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver gaine any generall applauſe or place in the Church till Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſte (having firſt gotten poſſeſſion of his vſurped vniverſal head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipp, to proportionate their eſtate in ſome degree like to his owne) did procure, for ſome of them, principallities, and for all of them, Baronnies, and allowed every one of them to domineire, as petty Monarches in the exerciſe of their ſpirituall juriſdiction, as ſhalbe proved in the proper place hereafter.</p>
                     <p>To goe on therefore vnto that which remayneth. The D. think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <note place="margin">Sect. 7. D. pag. 13. 14.</note> it <hi>ſtrange,</hi> that the doctrine of his ſermon concerninge <hi>Biſhops a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, ſhould vpholde the Popiſhe Hierarchie from the higheſt to the lowest aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well as our owne,</hi> and calleth it, <hi>a ſhameleſs vntruth;</hi> becauſe the Papiſts reckon. 5. <hi>orders vnder Deacons.</hi> But we, <hi>with the primitive Church, reckon but. 3. onely.

And therefore we have more cauſe to thinke it a ſtrange thing, that the Doctor ſhould be ignorant that many of his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments intended for the defence of his Bps alone; with the change of an Aſſumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, may ſerve as fitly to juſtify, thoſe inferior degrees which are vnder the Deacons in the Romiſh Synagogues. And yet it is more ſtrange, that he ſhould challenge conformitie with the primitive Church, in reckoning 3. degrees of Miniſters and ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more nor leſſe; ſeing the ſame authors that he alleadgeth for that purpoſe (ſerm: pag. 29. &amp;c.) doe reckon other degrees which wee have refuſed, and the Papiſts reteyne though in a more corrupt courſe, as all other Church functions are; and ſome more ancient doe recko<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> two onely, as his refuter in anſwere there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:14068:37"/> ſhewed.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, it is <hi>more then a wonder in the Dect. eyes, that the very ſame reaſons which are brought to justify the Apostolical goverment of our Church, ſhould alſo ſerve to prove their Antichriſtian Hierarchy, becauſe their Biſhops are ſubordinate to the Pope, and receive juriſdiction from him; but ours not ſo.</hi> But if his reaſoning be of any worthe, it may well be more then a wonder to his readers; if the example of the auncient &amp; Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Preſbyters, ſhould juſtify our pariſh Miniſters at this day. For, the former were all one with the Biſhops, in the Apoſtles times; &amp; received their juriſdiction, aſwell as their function from Chriſt, or the holy Ghoſt, Act. 20. 28; but ours now are ſubordinate to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and receive their juriſdiction from them. Nowithſtanding if the Doctor had adviſedly conſidered, that the queſtion is of fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions onely, and not of accidentall circumſtances; he would have <note place="margin">The D. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciption both idle and frive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.</note> ſpared this exception of his, as judging it both idle and frivolous. As for his concluſion, that <hi>there is but one ſmall agreement with the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Church concerninge the ſuperioritie of Biſhops over praeſbyters, out of which the Ref. would builde a totall conſent and conformitie to their Antichriſtian government;</hi> may it not be wondered at? 1. That he can find, but one agreement betwene the Proteſtant and the Popiſh go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Are there not the ſame degrees, Primates, Archbiſhops, Suffraganes, Archdeacons, Deanes &amp;c. Are there not the ſame ſeats of dignitie? The ſame authoritie and government?

The ſame pomp and glorie in the world? ſetting aſide the truth of doctrine and ſubordination to the Pope, non o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum ovo ſimilius. 2. That becauſe the Refuter ſaid, <hi>the doctrine of his ſermon tended to the vpholding of the popiſh Hierarchy from the Pope to the Apparator;</hi> he chargeth him to <hi>build a totall conſent and conformity;</hi> as if it may not tend to the vpholdinge of the Hierarchy, though with ſome differences?</p>

And how it is contradicted by that he ſpeaketh afterwards, appeareth throughout his whole booke, wherein every where he advanceth himſelfe above meaſure: yea in this very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, he ſtandeth upon the creditt of his evidence with a witnes, making this offer that <hi>he is well contented to be credited in nothing, if there be not better evidence in his ſermon and the defence of it, for the epiſcopall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; then is to be found for the diſcipline in queſion, in all the writings of the diſciplinarians;</hi> ſo advancing himſelf above all thoſe ſound and orthodoxall divines in the world, that are by all ſoundly lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, counted the lightes of the world. Thus can he play faſt and looſe, vp and downe, debaſe and advance himſelfe, as may make for advantage; before he was alofte as we have hearde, learned and skilful to judge of an argument, &amp;c. a faithfull Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, an orthodoxal divine &amp;c. nowe he is a meane man, &amp; ſo meane a man, as if he had not a fellow on his ſide to match him.

Yea pawneth his creditt concerning all that ever he wrote of what ſubject ſoever, upon his truth and ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in this one point. But let vs nowe ſee the double contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the refuters reaſons, as the Doctor calleth them; but it but one reaſon as the refuter hath layd it downe, &amp; the reader will not be ſo ſimple, as to make the firſt clauſe or me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of a ſentence, (as the Doctor here divideth it) a reaſon: that becauſe the Doctor is a Scholler, therefore he hath in his ſermon ſayd aſmuch, as can be <note place="margin">The D. diſmem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth the Ref. words and reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth ex male divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis.</note> ſayd of that argument. He mought well enough, for all that, have ſayd nothing to it: but the Doctor is very ready to divide, where his refuter conjoyneth, it ſeemeth to allude to his owne words page 146. His refuters reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was too ſtrong for him to deale with, whiles the Medius terminus, conſiſting of two branches, was bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d togither, and therefore he diſſolveth it, taking each branch by it ſelfe, indeavouring like a groſſe headed Sophiſter, to perſwade the reader, that becauſe he can bowe each twigge ſeverally, therefore he can breake the whole bundell or faggott.

But all this while, how proveth he that double contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction he ſpake of? Nay where doth the Ref. ſaye (as the D. inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuateth) that all that he and the men of his ſide can ſaie, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed in his ſermon? That which the Ref. ſaith, is poſſible e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, to witt, that the pith and ſubſtance of all (how much ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet it be,) that he and all of his ſide can ſay in this controverſy to any purpoſe, may be comprized in as ſhort a ſermon as his, which filleth vp an 100. pages; and was not onely preached, before that moſt honorable auditorie as he faith; but alſo vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſecond thoughts and mature deliberation enlarged, and publiſhed to the world.

Againe, he would prove his Refuter to be <hi>a worthleſse and a witleſſe fellow,</hi> becauſe he <hi>paſſed by the learned treatiſes of the worthies of their ſide, and made choiſe to contend with him, in the vanquiſhing of whom, there can come neyther creditt to himſelfe or his cauſe, nor diſadvantage to the adverſe part.</hi> But the reader can eaſily conceive the contrary; for in dealing <note place="margin">All former writers of the D. ſide are anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the anſwer to the doctor.</note> with the Doctor, who hath read thoſe accurate Treatiſes; and in his ſermon (as wee have reaſon to beleeve) layd downe the extract or quinteſſence, of that which all thoſe worthies could ſay therein; he dealeth after a ſort with them all, and anſwereth them all, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering him. Creditt enough therefore wilbe gayned to the Refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and his cauſe, with diſadvantage to the adverſe part; in caſe the D. (being the man that he maketh himſelfe to be, prefat. pag. 16. 17.) who had read vvhat all could ſay, and had the beſt helps of all that had vvritten before him, of that argument, and vvas vviſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make the beſt of that he read, for his advantage; ſhall yet in this queſtion ſhevve himſelfe (as his Refuter ſayth) <hi>but poore in deed.</hi> And vvhere to prove himſelfe to be neyther weake nor worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, he affirmeth that <hi>in his ſermon provided in 9. or 10. dayes at the moſt, he hath ſo fortified his cauſe, that the greatest worthies of oppoſites, aſſayling it with their forces, have not bene able in twice ſo many monthes to make the leaſt breach therin:</hi> I vviſh it may be conſidered vvhether it be not a boaſt of much riches, or no? 2. If we may beleeve reports, the greater part of that ſermon, vvas preached before at a viſitation, or
<pb facs="tcp:14068:46"/> aſſembly of Miniſters with great applauſe. But 3. it mattereth not whether it were provided in that time or no; ſeing he was above 9. or 10 dayes after the preaching of it, in reveiwing and enlarging of it (for enlarged it was as he ſayth preface 4.) for the preſſe, as the time of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of it forth, ſheweth: 4. He ſpeaketh with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out booke and more then is true, both in ſaying that the <hi>greatest worthies aſſayled it with all their force,</hi> and that the anſwerer was in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering it <hi>twice ſo many monthes as he was in providing it.</hi> Well may he knowe his owne time and helpers; but the Refuter knoweth that the beſt able or greateſt worthies, were ſo far from aſſayling it with all their force, that they touched it not with one of their fingers: and that he (one of the leaſt among many) was not ſo many weeks as the Doctor nameth monthes about it. Doth the Doctor with reaſon imagine or looke, that they who have neyther bookes, nor libertie for ſtudie, nor preſſe, nor purſe for eyther, at co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand, (as himſelfe hath,) can make ſo quick diſpatch as he? Lett him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure indifferencie herein; &amp; then blame vs for want of expedition. And with as litle reaſon argueth he, when he telleth us, that the greateſt worthies aſſayling it with all their forces, have not been able to make any breach therein, in twice ſo many monthes as he was dayes in providing his ſermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; as if becauſe they have not done it in that time, they therefore were not able to doe it. Well may he argue them of ſloth and negligence, but not of vnſufficiency &amp; vnablenes.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the matter; whether the Refuter (finding little in the D. ſermon which is not in the Biſhops booke, (from whence <note place="margin">Section. 3.</note> he profeſſeth to have received ſo good ſatiſfaction) and much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, verbatim, word for word with it) might not (ſuppoſe &amp;) ſay, <hi>it was but borrowed:</hi> I leave it to the indifferent reader, not to the D. (who is a partie) to judge. 2. The often references made thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, were not ſo much (as the D. ſayth) to ſhewe that what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered was taken thence: as to let the reader ſee, that both are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſvvered in one, hovvever he ſayth the Biſhops <hi>proofes are ſuch, as never were nor never wilbe anſwered.</hi> 3. To make good his charge <hi>of falſhood &amp; ſlaunderous libelling,</hi> vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Ref:, for ſaying his ſermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vvas borrovved of the Biſhop: he <hi>profeſſeth he is not conſcious to himſelf of taking any one line from any, without citing the author &amp;c.</hi> And yet confeſſeth a litle before, that <hi>diverſe of his allegations,</hi> were not of his owne firſt reading,
<pb facs="tcp:14068:47"/> but examined at the founteine, being as it were, ſent thither for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by them whom he read: the which as the Refuter denied not; ſo the contrary to which, he affirmed not, neyther had reaſon, ſeing it vvas fitt in deed, he ſhould examine them by the firſt Authors (where ever he mett with them at the ſecond hand) whether they were true or no. Laſtly as for his praiſe ſett upon the oldneſſe of the ſtuffe, <hi>becauſe that which is the oldest is the truest:</hi> it is but an idle begging of that queſtion, which will not be graunted him; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">The Doct. beggeth the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> out of queſtion, that it was (as the refuter ſaith) built out of the Biſhops old ſtuffe: not of the oldeſt ſtuffe, or of his ſtuffe, which is the Ancient of dayes. And therefore as Salomon (Prov. 16. 31.) ſaith of old age, ſo ſay I of it: It is then honourable and worthy of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation, when it is found in the way of righteouſnes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which figure, it is but as a cypher, whoſe value in divinity, is nothing worth.</p>
                     <p>But, to let all paſſe, come we nowe to the 3. point, and examine <note place="margin">Sect. 4. ad Sect. 3. Def. lib. 1. Cap. 1. pa. 27.</note> we, whether the Refuter deſerveth to be cenſured, as a man <hi>that spent his ſplene vpon the text, captiouſly carping at the choiſe of it,</hi> yea or no? The Refuters words, whereon the Doctor taketh occaſion ſo to cenſure him, are (not as the Doctor layeth them downe, (out of an abortive booke as he calleth it) thereby ſhewing how greedy he himſelfe is of carping: but as the Refuter himſelf in his anſwere, pag. 2. line 5. 6. hath them, namely) theſe. <hi>The text being allegori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, (as himſelf confeſſeth) digge he deep and doe what he can, he ſhall hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly finde fast ground, whereon to lay his foundation.</hi> Can any man that judgeth his text vnfitt for his purpoſe, deliver his opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in milder termes? Is there any one word, that ſavoureth of <hi>captious carping?</hi> Yet if there were, is it all one to <hi>to carp at the choiſe of the text,</hi> and to <hi>spend of his spene</hi> upon the text it ſelf? But, not to ſtay vpon this any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, the Doctor telleth vs, that <hi>though the quarrel pleaſed the refuter ſo well, that he repeateth it againe, page 3. yet without cauſe;</hi> for that, <hi>ſeing the expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the allegorie is not doubtful, but confeſſed on both ſides, that as by 7. ſtarres are meant the 7. angels; ſo by the angels, the Bps. of the Churches: who ſeeth not, that this aſſertio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the calling of the Biſhops is lawfull and good, is built on the foundation of the Apoſtle Iohn, as it were vpon a rock?</hi> But 1. lett him certify us, 1. touching the expoſition of the allegorie in his text, and that if it be nothing doubtfull, but confeſſed (or agreed on) on both ſides, why he doth, in the 2. pag. of his
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:14068:47"/> ſermon, prepoſe this, as a doubtfull point needfull to be examined. viz. <hi>who and what manner of perſons are ment by the angels of the Churches?</hi>

                     <p>2. Moreover, can he without bluſhing ſaye, <hi>that it is confeſſed on</hi>

                     <p>3.

Starres are the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of the 7. Churches.</hi> See, ſee, how faine he would (if he could) <note place="margin">The D. beggeth of us, what he dareth not give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</note> wringe from us an acknowledgement of that which himſelf, well adviſed (I ſuppoſe) dareth not affirme namely, that an allegoricall texte is as fittly choſen, to prove any concluſion, as another which vnfoldeth the ſame more plainely. But it ſhall not be amiſſe, to lett him ſee the ſtrength of his conſequence by another of like force.</p>
                     <p>Our adverſaries (the D. I meane, &amp; the men of his ſide) doe affirme and teach that the Angels were dioceſan Biſhops ſuperiour in degree to other Miniſters; and that the 7. Churches which they governed were properly, Dioceſes. Therefore in their opinion, the text was as fittly choſen, as if it had bin ſaid, the 7. Starres are the dioceſan Biſhops, who having a ſuperiority in degree over other Miniſters, did overſee the 7. dioceſes, or dioceſan Churches in Aſia. 2. As for the replie, which he aſcribeth to his Refuter (viz. that though it be granted, that the Angels are Biſhops, yet not ſuch Biſhops as <note place="margin">The D. vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truely fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth on the Refut: what he ſaid not.</note> the D. ſpeaketh of) if it had bin as truly his, as it is vntruly fathered on him; yet he giveth him no cauſe, to anſwere as he doth. viz. <hi>then the vnfittnes of the text (belike) is not becauſe it is allegorical, but becauſe in his conceite, it is impertinent.</hi> He ſhould rather have inferred thus, Then I ſee the text is vnfitt in a double reſpect: in parte, becauſe it is alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goricall; and cheefly becauſe, (though the meaning of the allegory be thus farr agreed on, that it is confeſſed the Angels were Biſhops, yet) it is a great controverſy whether they were ſuch Biſhops as the Biſhops of our Church are. But the D. giveth litle hope, that he will of his owne accord, confeſſe ſo much; this, <hi>belike,</hi> ſhal be anſwered with another, inferred vpon a more ſure ground. It is certeine the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:14068:48"/> conſent of Interpreters (being ſo farr divided (as he acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, pag. 7. touching the nature of the function of theſe Angels) can give his text no fitnes to conclude his purpoſe. Belike there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fitnes that the Doctor imagineth to be in it, is becauſe in his owne conceit it is pertinent, induced therevnto perhaps by the judgement of ſome fewe that are parties in the cauſe. But his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit (though ſupported with the approbation of ſome that favour the Hierarchy) is too light to be layd in the ballance againſt the judgment of all thoſe Proteſtant wryters, which vary from him in the explication of his text.</p>
                     <p>3. Laſtly, where 1. he would ſett the newer and elder diſciplina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians (as he termeth them) at odds, about the interpretation of the text; that the one ſhould underſtand it of <hi>all Miniſters in generall,</hi> the other, <hi>of the Preſidents of the Preſbyteries onely.</hi> And 2. that againſt them both, <hi>he proveth by the text it ſelfe, and by other divine evidence; that the calling of dioceſan Biſhops, is in this text commended vnto vs, vnder this title of the Angels of the Churches:</hi> we are to knowe, that for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, they agree well enough; for however ſome underſtand it of the Preſidents; yet they meane ſuch perſons, as were alſo of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſort of Miniſters, though for the time of the aſſembly, choſen <note place="margin">The D. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voucheth that of both, which is true in neither.</note> Preſidents. As for the latter, I marveile he durſt ſo boldly avouch it of both; ſeing it is true in neyther; as I doubt not but the reader will confeſſe with me. Thus much in defenſe of the refuters firſt reaſon for miſtiking the Doctors choiſe of his text. viz. becauſe it is allegoricall.</p>
                     <p>It remayneth that I remember the reader of an other reaſon, ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <note place="margin">Sect. 6. ad page 27. Def: in fine</note> by the Refuter (anſw. pag. 2.) againſt the Doctors choiſe of his text to iuſtify our Biſhops callings; viz. That whereas others deny that the angels of the Churches were (as the Doct. affirmeth) Dioceſan Biſhops, he doth not once <hi>offer to prove the meaning of his text to be ſo by any other ſcripture, or ſound expoſitor of it.</hi> Now as it was needfull for the backing of the interpretation of his text, to have produced ſome: ſo queſtionleſſe M.

In deed he giveth vs a direct anſwere herevnto in that laſt ſentence of page 27. where he ſayth, <hi>Though ſome object that by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are meant eyther all Miniſters in generall, or the Preſidents of the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters;

For there having the words of his text before his eyes, <hi>The 7. ſtarrs are the Angels of the 7. Churches,</hi> &amp; conſidering to what end he had choſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his text, (viz. to juſtify the honourable fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our Engliſh Prelates); he vndertaketh in the firſt place, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to prove, <hi>that the Angels of thoſe Churches were Biſhops (for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of their calling) ſuch as our Biſhops are.</hi> And ſecondly out of the words to ſhewe, <hi>that the office and function of Biſhops, here meant by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, is in this text both approved as lawfull, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended as excellent.</hi> Will the D. ſay, that in ſenſe and meaning (for in words they are not) theſe are all one with the two firſt? Nay his conſcience will tel him, that in each propoſition both termes (I meane the <hi>ſubiectum</hi> and the <hi>predicatum)</hi> have received ſuch a change, that the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, cannot be truely ſayd to be the ſame with the two later. For in that firſt, (which he ſaith is an explication of the text) lett him ſhame the Divill and ſpeake the truth, and tell us, what moved him to add, the word <hi>primitive</hi> to the <hi>ſubiect,</hi> and the word <hi>Dioceſan</hi> to the <hi>Predicate</hi> of that aſſertion? Shall I help to informe the reader, till his owne anſwere may be heard? He was reſolved (the event de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth it) to make the beſt defenſe he could, for the calling of this Dioceſan Biſhops; yet not ſo much by the text, which he choſe; or by any other teſtimony of ſcripture; (for then fewer lines might have ſerved his turne, then are nowe the leaves of his ſermon) as by the authoritie of fathers &amp; councels, wherof he had greater ſtore, and ſuch as (in his owne apprehenſion) made a fayrer ſhewe for his purpoſe. Hence is it, that in the winding up of all that he had ſpoken for the proofe of his firſt aſſertion, (to make the concluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more ſutable to the premiſes) he brought his whole diſcourſe to this yſſue, (ſerm. pag. 52.) <hi>Thus you have heard, that the Angels or Biſhops of the primitive Church, were, for the ſubstance of their calling, ſuch as our Biſhops are.</hi> Where note, he ſaith not, the angels of the 7. churches in S. Iohns time, were ſuch Bps. (yet that was the point, he promiſed to prove) but <hi>the angels or Biſhops of the primitive church, were ſuch.</hi> Vnderſtanding by the primitive Church, the ages ſucce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, for 300 yeares after the Apoſtles dayes, (as appeareth by
<pb facs="tcp:14068:50"/> ſerm. pag. 56. &amp; 57. and by Def. lib. 3. page 12 and 14.) which when he hath made the beſt of it, that he can; is but an idle digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from his text, not a right explication thereof. Yet in this veine, <note place="margin">The D. di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſeth from his text: doth not rightly explicate it</note> he perſiſteth throughout his defence, giving vs for the true and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall explication of his text, the ſame general aſſertion: whereof ſee lib. 1. pag. 54. lib. 2. pag. 41. &amp; lib. 3. pag. 22. Onely in theſe places (like as before) he addeth the word <hi>Dioceſan</hi> in the <hi>predicate,</hi> or later terme of the ſentence, to conforme this firſt aſſertion, with the ſecond of the laſt edition, (viz. <hi>the calling of Dioceſan Biſhops is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and good)</hi> that he might with the better colour commend the later vnto us, as the Doctrine which floweth from the former. For which cauſe alſo, he ſeemeth here to limitt his firſt aſſertion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaſſe of his text, vnto thoſe Paſtors or Biſhops, which are here meant by <hi>angels:</hi> he ſeemeth (I ſay) here to doe it; and he doth it in deed, in the laſt ſection of this chapter, and page 3. lib. 4. where he ſeriouſly mindeth the collecting of his doctrine from the text; yet, in incloſing thoſe words, <hi>here meant by angels,</hi> within a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentheſis, he ſeemeth withall to intimate to his reader, that thoſe words may wel be ſpared; &amp; the ſentence nevertheleſſe ſtand perfect without them; as it doth in the places before noted, even as oft as he aimeth at the reducing of his 4. firſt points (ſerm. pag. 6. &amp; 7.) vnto one co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon concluſion. Thus he windeth out and in at his <note place="margin">The Doct. windeth in and out, at pleaſure.</note> pleaſure, and vnder termes that carry a double conſtruction, hath fitted his firſt aſſertion to a double purpoſe. What ſhall I ſay to him? Would he thus have done, if he had hated double dealing &amp; ſophiſticall ſhifting in himſelfe, as much as he ſeemeth to loath it in his Refuter; who gave him farr leſſe cauſe, what ſay I? yea, to ſpeake truth, no cauſe at all, ſo to accuſe him of any ſuch offence? Let the reader Iudge.</p>
                     <p>But let us goe on, and compare togither the 2. aſſertion (to uſe his owne phraſe) of the newe edition, with the 2. point propoſed, <note place="margin">Sect. 3.</note> ſerm. pag. 2. In the one he roaveth at randome, and affirmeth of Dioceſan Biſhops at large, (at leaſt of all ſuch as ours be, for ſo he expoundeth himſelf, lib. 4. pag. 3.) <hi>that their calling is lawfull &amp; good:</hi> In the other, reteyning a ſpeciall reference to his text and the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels there mentioned, he ſaith, <hi>that the function of Biſhops, there meant by the angels, is in the text it ſelfe, approved as lawful and commended as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent.</hi> Howſoever the Doctor be ſtrongly perſwaded, that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:14068:51"/> of whom his text ſpeaketh, were Dioceſan Biſhops, for the ſubſtance of their calling, like to ours; yet is he not ſurely, ſo farr bereaved of his ſenſes, but he can diſcerne a difference, not onely betweene thoſe ancient Biſhops, in particular, and thoſe to whom he reſembleth them; or Dioceſan Biſhops in generall: but alſo betweene the lawfulnes of their callings diſtinctly conſidered.

                     <p>In his 5. ſection, two things may be commended to the readers <note place="margin">Sect. 4. ad ſect. 5. Def. p. 35.</note> obſervation. Firſt, the Refut: ſaying (pag. 4.) <hi>that it was in deed
<pb facs="tcp:14068:51"/> needfull to inquire what manner of Biſhops thoſe Angels were; becauſe Biſhop, Bilſon, and Biſhop Barloe, had fancied to themſelves another ſort of Biſhops then eyther the Holy Ghoſt hath mentioned in the newe Teſtament; or any ſound divine offred to teach thereout.</hi> The Doct. from thence inferreth, <hi>that the controverſie which remayneth to be decided is this, viz. whether ſort of Biſhops, ſuch as thoſe learned and himſelf defendeth; or ſuch as his adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and his adhaerents stand for; is that kinde of Biſhop, which hath beene of late deviſed.</hi> Where it is eaſy to be ſeene, howe cunningly he chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth <note place="margin">The D. changeth the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> the queſtion; he ſhould have ſayd, The controverſie to be deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded is this, <hi>whether the Holy Ghoſt doth vnderſtand by the Angels of the Churches, Rev. 1. 20. ſuch Biſhops, as our Engliſh Praelates are; or rather ſuch as his Refuter, and his adhaerents stand for?</hi> But wittily, and not vnwit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly doth he ſhun this controverſie; for, it ſeemeth, he knoweth that to be true which his Refuter added, to witt, that if the vſe of the word Biſhop, manifeſtly warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted vnto vs by God in his word, and the joynt interpretation of all proteſtant divines, would have contented him &amp; others of his ſide, we neyther had need, nor oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of this examination. Wherefore though he offreth two things to our conſideration, for the deciding of the former queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, viz. <hi>what manner of Churches they were, whereof they were Angels; &amp; what manner of preheminence they had in thoſe Churches:</hi> yet he cloſly ſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <note place="margin">The D. cloſely ſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from debating pointes propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and then brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth &amp;c.</note> from the debating of them, and propoundeth his 5. points before noted, (diverſe from theſe) to be handled in their ſtead. So that his firſt aſſertion, which he promiſed plainly to prove, hath none other direct proofe, then the bare propounding of thoſe two queſtions, which he offreth to our conſideration. Which the D. knoweth well enough; notwithſtanding he braggeth of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and adjureth his reader, in the name of God without partiallity, to ſee on which ſide is better evidence and more pregnant proofs, and to aſſent therevnto.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, where the Doct. vndertaking to prove out of his text, <hi>that the office and function of his Dioceſan Biſhops is lawfull and good;</hi> &amp; the Refuter tolde him, it was ſoone ſayd, but not ſo ſoone done, there being nothing in his text to prove it; becauſe, to be <hi>lights, ſtarrs, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> (which was all the D. had ſaid, or could ſhew out of the words) is not proper to his Dioceſans, but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to all true Paſtors of particular congregations, as himſelfe had taught in his ſermon of the dignitie and dutie of the Miniſters. pag. 20, 61. The D. reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:14068:52"/> indeed, but as a man out of temper, chargeth his Ref: <hi>to wran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, and to have nothi g to ſay, but that which with an idle cocciſme, he often repeateth, and in this place is altogether impertinent, and that he was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved aforehand, to cavill, with whatſoever he ſhould find in his booke. &amp;c.</hi> Whereunto I will ſay nothing, but this, that concerning the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Doctor, and truth of his ſpeach, I will not, the D. is a party, he muſt not, lett the reader indifferent therefore, judge.</p>

                        </gap> theſe words of truth and ſobernes, as Feſtus was at the words of Paul; was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to take up his anſwere, <hi>(much learning hath made thee madd)</hi> ſave that he would not aſcribe to his Refut: any learning at all; &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore chooſeth rather to ſay, that <hi>too much wrath (which is furor brevis) made him ſo to forgett himſelf, that he wrangleth without witt, and againſt ſenſe.</hi> But I wiſh the reader conſider, whether the Doctor doth not overraſhly judge him ſick of his owne diſeaſe? For what can he ſay eyther to excuſe himſelf, or juſtly to blame his Refuter? For ſooth, that <hi>no man that is in his witts, will ſay, it is not lawfull for a preacher to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine his text.</hi> True, but if the Refuter never ſayd it, and if the Doct. cannot extract any ſuch thing from his wordes; may not the reader worthily cenſure him, for a mallicious ſlanderer? 2.

But ſince he hath not once indeavoured thus to handle his two points; (which himſelf acknowledgeth, ought to have bene diſcuſſed for the clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the text) what ſhould hinder the Refuter or his Reader ſtill to affirme, that his text (in regard of theſe two doubts) ſtandeth ſtill vnexplained, and his firſt aſſertion left vnproved? 4. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, the D. thus reaſoneth, <hi>If the text be that which is to be explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, who could be ſo ſenſleſſe, as eyther to require that theſe points ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained by the text, or to find fault, that by the handling of them, the text is explained?</hi> I anſwere firſt, to the laſt accuſation. If the fault which <note place="margin">The Doct. ſlau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dreth.</note> the Refuter findeth, be not ſuch as the Doctor mentioneth, but rather the contrary; viz. that he goeth about to teach vs the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his text, without any due handling of thoſe points, by the bare co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mending of them to our conſideration: then, whether the Doctor be not againe worthy to be cenſured, eyther for a blinde and inconſiderate, or for an vncharitable and mallicious ſlande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, lett the chriſtian reader judge. As touching the other, who <note place="margin">The D. ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth ſenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gettfull.</note> would have thought him to have bin ſo ſenſleſs, or at leaſt forgett<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as he ſeemeth to be, eyther, in judging that his Refuter ment to limitt him in his explication, vnto the words of the text, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine it by it ſelf, without any other help; the contrary whereof is plaine to be ſeene (in his anſwere, pag. 3. &amp; 4.) or in deeming it abſurd and impoſſible, for a text of ſcripture to be explained by it ſelf; ſeing he himſelf explaineth and proveth by the very words of his text, (ſerm. pag. 2. &amp; 3.) his ſecond aſſertion, concerning the qualitie of their function. But the cauſe is reaſonable, why the D. dooth the one, and leaveth the other vndone. For his 2. aſſertion, viz. <hi>that the function of the Biſhops, meant by angels in his text, is of God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved as lawfull,</hi> doth clearly in all mens underſtanding ariſe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the very name of <hi>ſtars</hi> and <hi>angels:</hi> but it is not ſo eaſy, (nay it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible) to drawe out of thoſe wordes, or any other circumſtances of the text, ſuch a preheminence above other Miniſters, as his firſt aſſertion attributeth to theſe angels, when it affirmeth them, to be ſuch Biſhops (for the ſubſtance of their calling) as ours are. Wherefore, it was the Doctors wiſdome (if it were worthy of that
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:14068:53"/> name) not to deliver us any one proofe (ſyllogiſtically concluded) throughout his large defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: but to ſtopp his readers mouth every where with ſuch words as theſe, <hi>the text is rightly expounded of Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan Biſhops, And, I doubt not by Gods help to make it evident; that ſuch Biſhops are here meant by ſtarres and Angels. Yea it is proved, that Dioceſan Biſhops are here meant by angels.</hi> But hereof more when I come to the 2. laſt ſections.</p>
                     <p>As for the two next ſections, there being nothing in them, but <note place="margin">Sect. 6. ad ſect. 7. &amp; 8.

But in ſo hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous a crime as this is, <hi>(laeſae Maieſtatis)</hi> it may be a deed of charity to defend them; a word of two of it therefore.</p>
                     <p>The Doctor being diſpleaſed with them, that argue our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, to be therefore no members, of any true viſible Church, becauſe they are not members of ſome one onely pariſhe; did <note place="margin">The D. ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to his oppoſites reaſon a malicious ſpeach; &amp; now ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a falſe gloſſe upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it.</note> falſly and maliciouſly add, <hi>that in theſe mens conceits, it must needs be the Kings owne caſe.</hi> In deed, if any of them had at any time pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, or given the leaſt ſuſpicion of this conceite, that the King is not a member of any one particular congregation, (ſuch as we define a pariſh to be) there had beene reaſon for his inference: But the D. knoweth that they all holde the King and his houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold to be an intire Church, or diſtincte congregation by it ſelf. Wherefore if mallice and ſelfe-love, had not too much prevailed with him; he would (vpon his ſecond thought) have
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:14068:53"/> revoked his ſlaunderous inference, and not have ſett a falſe gloſſe upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it, to make it ſeeme the more probable; for thus he reaſoneth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Kinge having a more generall reference to all the Churches with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his dominions (as being the governour of them all in greate Britta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie and Ireland) is further from being a member of one onely pariſh, then any Biſhop in this kingdome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Therefore by what reaſon they deny the Biſhops to be members of the true Church; (becauſe forſooth they be not of ſome particular pariſh) by the ſame, they may aſwell denye the Kinge to be a member of the true Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whereunto I anſwere. 1. If he had any intent (by this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) to juſtifye his former ſlaunder; in ſtead of theſe words in his concluſion; <hi>they may aſwell deny the King &amp;c.</hi> he ſhould have ſaid, <hi>in their conceit they doe and must deny &amp;c.</hi> which he cannot with any colour conclude, vnleſſe he will add to his Antecedent the like words, <hi>(in their conceit and opinion)</hi> and ſaye, that in theire <note place="margin">The D pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth one ſlaunder by another, or reaſoneth abſurdly.</note> judgement and conceit the King is further from being a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of one onely pariſh, then of any Biſhop in the kingdome. But this were to prove one ſlander by another; for they whom he ſlaundereth doe acknowledge, that notwithſtanding his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall reference to all the Churches in great Brittanie and Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, whereof he is ſupreme governour by his Kingly office, yet in aſmuch as he ſubmitteth himſelfe and his family, to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Miniſterie of thoſe whom he hath choſen to diſpenſe the word and ſacraments, to him and to them; he is a member of a true viſible Church, (or if you will) of one certaine pariſh, that is to ſay, (of one particular congregation of Chriſtians, aſſembled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither in one place, for the ſolemne and publique ſervice of God. 2. If the Doctor be of a contrary opinion, then he reaſoneth ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdly from his owne falſe imagination, (that the King is further then any Biſhop from being a member of one onely pariſh) to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And hence it
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:14068:54"/> will followe that in his conceite, the King is not a member of any one certeine viſible Church: for by one viſible Church, the D. mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, <hi>the chriſtian people of one dioceſe or province, or at the moſte of one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For the chriſtian people lyving vnder diverſe lawes (as the people of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and Scotland doe) are diverſe nations, and ſo diverſe viſible Churches,</hi> if we may beleeve his owne wordes lib. 3. p. 51. 52. Wherefore the vnpartiall reader, may eaſily ſee, that this odious crime, (of denying the King to be a member of a true viſible Church) falſly and ſpite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully aſcribed to them, againſt whom he dealeth; doth truely and juſtly light vpon himſelf. As for the queſtion which he moveth, whither they holde the King and his houſhold <hi>to be a true Church? That ſo he may be thought to be a member of a true Church?</hi> though the Q. be needleſſe, and ſufficiently anſwered already, yet know he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine and againe, that they hold the Kinge and his familye to be a true viſible Church, not onely a member of a true Church; and the King in regard of his regall office, a moſt noble member excelling all other, though the Doct. ſeemeth to be otherwiſe perſwaded, not onely of the King as is before ſhewed, but perhaps alſo of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miley; becauſe it is not as other pariſhes are, a ſubordinate mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of any one dioceſe, nor conſtantly ſubjected to the juriſdiction of the dioceſan Biſhop.</p>
                     <p>His laſt reaſon, <hi>why we may not with the like reaſon acknowledge the Biſhop and his family to be an entire</hi> (Church he ſhould ſay, but he ſaith) <hi>familie by themſelves?</hi> I will anſwere when I finde him better diſpoſed to receive it, then he was, when to the ende of his queſtion, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>It is no matter what they holde, vnleſſe they were more learned and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious.</hi> In the meane time, lett him bethink himſelf what to anſwere to theſe queſtions. 1. Whether every Biſhop, or any one of them, doth alike ſubject himſelf as the King doth to the paſtorall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of any one or moe, that doo ordinarily diſtribute the word and ſacramentes to his whole familye? 2. Whither any Biſhop re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidinge, with his familye in another dioceſe (as the Arch Biſhops alwaiſe doe, and ſome others for the moſt parte doe) he and his familey be (as other pariſhes are) ſubject to his juriſdiction, in whoſe dioceſe they are? 3. And if the Biſhop be the paſtor of his familey and his chapleines aſſiſtants to him, for the paſtorall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight therof, whether we may not affirme their families to be ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Preſidents of pariſhes governed by a pariſh preſ bytery?</p>

                     <p>In 3. ſections following, the Doctor beſtirreth himſelf to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover <note place="margin">Sect. 7. ad ſect. 9. Def. pag. 40.</note> his credit with his Dioceſan Biſhops, who by a reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on his owne words were proved (by the Refuter, page 6.) to be abſolute Popelings. The reaſon was layd downe to him in this forme.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>They who have not onely ſupreme, but alſo ſole authoritie in cauſes eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall, are abſolute Popelings. All Dioceſan Biſhops have not onely ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme, but alſo ſole authoritie in cauſes eccleſiasticall. Therefore all Dioceſan Biſhops are abſolute Popelings.</hi> The Doct. ſcorning that this ſhould be called his reaſon, ſayth, <hi>That there is nothing in it his, but the propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which alſo is ſtretched, beyond not onely his meaning, but his wordes.</hi> His wordes are theſe (ſerm. pag. 4.) <hi>least they might ſeeme to ſett up an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute popeling in every pariſh, who ſhould have not only ſupreme but alſo ſole au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie in cauſes eccleſiaſticall, they adioyne unto him, (that is, to their Paſtor) a conſiſtorie of lay or governing elders.</hi> Out of theſe words (ſaith the Def: pag. 40.) <hi>I deny not, but this propoſition may be framed. They who give to a Biſhop, not onely ſupreme, but alſo ſole authoritie in cauſes eccleſiaſticall, doe ſeeme to ſett vp an abſolute popeling.</hi> And why not (or better) that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, which his Refuter urgeth? In deed if he had ſayd, They ſeeme to ſett vp an abſolute popelinge, in giving to their pariſhe Biſhop, not onely ſupreme, but alſo ſole authority &amp;c: his propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition had more naturally flowed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his words, then now it doth: but ſince he ſaith <hi>an abſolute popeling, which ſhould have both ſupreme &amp; ſole authoritie &amp;c.</hi> he very clearely deſcribeth in theſe laſt words, (of <hi>having ſuch an authoritie as he speaketh of)</hi> what he meant by an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute popeling, namely ſuch a Paſtor or Biſhop, as hath not onely ſupreme, but alſo ſole authoritie in cauſes eccleſiaſtical. Wherefore he may aſwell deny it to be day-light at high-noone, as deny that the Refuter rightly drewe his propoſition from his wordes before expreſſed.</p>
                     <p>2. Moreover put caſe, a man ſhould contradict the propoſition, which himſelf acknowledgeth to agree with his words and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; muſt he not be inforced for the proofe thereof to aſſume, ſome ſuch aſſertion as that is, which the Refuter propoundeth. viz. that he is an abſolute popeling who hath (in any pariſh or dioceſe) ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme and ſole authoritie in cauſes eccleſiaſticall?</p>
                     <p>3. Yea doth he not elſwhere in his ſermon (pag. 17. &amp; 51.) with out any <hi>ſeeming,</hi> affirme in plaine termes, that <hi>the pariſh Biſhop, or
<pb facs="tcp:14068:55"/> Paſtor of every pariſh, muſt rule as a Pope vnleſſe he be aſſiſted with a preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie, or ſubjected to the dioceſan Biſhops authority?</hi> Yea that it is <hi>to ſett vp a Pope in every pariſh, if the Paſtors doe rule alone, neyther ſubject to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, nor reſtreyned by Aſſiſtantes?</hi> In like manner, in this defence (lib. 1. cap. 8. pa. 194.) ſaith he not, that their pariſh Biſhops whom they <hi>make the</hi> ſupreme eccleſiaſticall officers, <hi>would be</hi> (he ſaith not might ſeeme to be, but would be) <hi>abſolute popelinges, if preſbyteries were not adjoyned vnto them, becauſe they ſhall have not onely ſupreme, but alſo ſole authority?</hi> It is therefore a meere cavill joyned with an evident vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth; <note place="margin">The D. j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

He is likewiſe to be ſo vnderſtood as ofte as he objecteth againſt our Biſhops, <hi>that having ſole and ſupreme au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, they rule as Popes or Popelinge;</hi> wherefore the aſſumption which the D. rejecteth, as falſe and fooliſh, or frivolous, is this in effecte. <hi>That all dioceſan Biſhops have</hi> (or ought to have in the D. opinion) <hi>not onely ſupreme but alſo ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Here the Aſſumption is in it ſelf evident, if the queſtion debated, be ſuch as is before noted; which none of his freinds need to doubt of, ſince the D. himſelf excepteth not againſt it, but intreateth the reader to take notice of the ſtate of the queſtion for future uſe (pag. 41.) and when he repeateth it (cap. 3. pag. 61.) he acknowledgeth it to be rightly ſett downe, in reſpect of the partes of the diſfuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Whence it followeth alſo that the propoſition of the proſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſme ſtandeth firme. For in this queſtion (to uſe his owne words cap. 3. pag. 60. 61.) he muſt confeſſe, (vnleſſe he will confeſſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be ignorant in logicke) that this diſjunction is implyed.

That all is given to the Biſhop alone.</hi> To prove the firſt an vntruth, he firſt granteth one parte of it true, ſaying <hi>the Elders in deed, I reject as a new deviſe.</hi> 2.

                     <p>2. But how will theſe parts of power or authority thus allowed them by the D. prove an vntruth in the Refuter when he ſaid, that the queſtion being (as he ſaid) whether the Church ſhould be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by Paſtors and Elders with the people, or by Dioceſan Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, <hi>the Doctor taketh all from them all, &amp;c.</hi> Muſt not that <hi>all</hi> which is ſaid to be taken away, be limitted to the queſtion before propoſed? q. d. all that power of government (which is contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted whether it belongeth to the Paſtors with the elders &amp; peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of every pariſh, or to the Biſhop in his whole Dioceſe, <hi>all</hi> this I ſay,) the Doctor taketh from the Paſtors Elders &amp; people, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the ſame (not <hi>all</hi> ſimply) into the hands of his Dioceſan Biſhop alone. And in this ſenſe (which is the true ſenſe, though the Doct. ſhifteth out of it) the refuters words are true, as before is ſhewed. <note place="margin">The Doct. ſhifteth the ſenſe.</note> Neyther can the Doctor without ſhame, deny it; ſeing that exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall power of government which ſtandeth cheefly in ordeyning, cenſuring and abſolving &amp;c. is the thing controverted in the quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion before expreſſed, which the Doctor holdeth to be the Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan Biſhops right, and unlawfully given to the pariſh-Biſhop &amp; his Elders.

Wherefore, if the Doctor will diſcharge himſelfe from giving all the power of government in queſtion, to one Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop alone in his Dioceſe (and ſo be guiltleſſe of the vntruth, he chargeth on the Refuter) he muſt both affirme and prove, that the Archdeacons and Deanes (rurall and cathedrall) togither with the Chauncelors and officialls, which now rule vnder the Biſhop, and the Archbiſhop with his courts, which are above him; be of divine inſtitution, or at leaſt were in vſe, in the time of the Apoſtles, and ſo derived to ſucceeding ages. And yet, if he could and ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formo this hereafter; it ſhall nothing weaken the Refuters aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who examining the tenor of his ſermon (and finding therein no intimation, eyther of any aſſiſtants to reſtreyne his Dioceſan Biſhop, or any ſuperior court to rule over him) did therefore true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Sect. 10. ad Section 11. page. 43.

                     <p>As for thoſe two vntruthes, which he ſought and profeſſeth to finde in the propoſition, they doe (even as the former two) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne home into his owne boſome.

And if the D. judgement be demaunded, which is the higheſt ordinary Church-officer in ſuch a Church, let him thinke with himſelfe whether he muſt not be inforced to affirm aſmuch of his dioceſan Biſhop, or at leaſt of his Archbiſhop? For if all the viſible Churches planted by the Apoſtles, and indowed with power of eccleſiaſticall government, were dioceſes properly (as he confidently ſaith) and if he dare not reſolutely affirme and for a certeine truth (as he dareth not but thinketh onely lib. 2. cap. 6. pag. 114.) that Metropolitans were (I ſay not inſtituted, but) intended by the Apoſtles; why may it not be concluded that in his opinion, the dioceſan Biſhop, is he higheſt ordinarie officer eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall, in every true viſible Church inſtituted in the new teſtamet? Wherefore ſince it is apparant by the tenor of his ſermon (ſpecially by pag. 44. 45. &amp; 90.); that he giveth to the Biſhop a peereleſſe power of rule, aſwell over the preſbyters as the people of his dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſe;
<pb facs="tcp:14068:59"/> that maie be truly affirmed of his dioceſan Biſhop, (which he falſly ſaith of the pariſh Biſhop) that he is a petty Pope in regard of that ſupremacie, which he aſcribeth vnto him. If he had rather beſtowe this honor, vpon his Metropolitan Biſhop; becauſe (to prove that no Church in the world is more agreable, to the forme and government of the moſt ancient and Apoſtolicall Churches, then this of England) he ſaith (in that 114. pag. lib. 2.) <hi>that at the firſt Metropolitans were, autokephaloi, heades by themſelves of their provinces, and not ſubordinate to any other ſuperiour Biſhops;</hi> as it muſt needes be granted him, that the title doth beſeeme him much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, becauſe the ſupremacie of his juriſdiction is farr larger: ſo it <note place="margin">The D. fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth into another vn truth.</note> in denying any of our Biſhops, to be the ſupreme eccleſiaſticall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer in his Church.

                     <p>But that which is further added touching the Paſtours with their elders and people, (viz. <hi>that they have</hi> (as the Pope ſaith he hath) <hi>a ſupreme immediate and independent authority ſufficient for the government of their Churches in all cauſes eccleſiaſticall, and therefore for m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Elſe why doth he, for the confuting and ſupreſſing of their pariſhonal government ſet downe this aſſertion, namely, that the viſible chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches (ſuch as he ſpeaketh of) indowed with power of eccleſiaſticall government, were Dioceſes properly, and not pariſhes? The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon therefore ſtandeth much better betweene the Pope and the Dioceſan Biſhop, in this manner. As Papiſts ſay, their Pope hath
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:14068:60"/> an independent, and immediate authority, from Chriſt, over all the Paſtors and people within his charge, (which is the Catholike Church or vniverſal ſocietie of Chriſtians throughout the world) &amp; a power ſufficient, for the eccleſiaſticall government of all Churches every where: ſo ſiath the Doctor and his aſſociates, that every Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oceſan Biſhop hath an immediate and independent authority from Chriſt, over all the people of his Dioceſe (which is his charge) and ſufficient for the eccleſiaſticall government of all Churches within his juriſdiction: ſee pag. 14. of his anſwere to the preface, &amp; ſerm. pag. 52. As for Synodes, if they be lawfully called, well ordered, and their conſtitutions, by royall authority ratified; the Doctor can give neyther more honour, nor obedience to them, then they doe; (as their proteſtation ſheweth. Art. 8, 12. 13. 14.) If they want regall authoritie to aſſemble or to ratify them; they thinke, that by divine or apoſtolicall ordinance, their decrees or canons ought not to be impoſed on any Churches, without their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and free conſents. See H. I. in his reaſons for reform: pag. 31. And if this alſo be a papall priveledge; how will he exempt his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oceſan Biſhop, from being like herein to the Pope, when he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Archbiſhop, not provinciall Synode, to impoſe any lawes on him? Or the Archbiſhop and primate of all England, who at this day, acknowledgeth no ſuperiority of any ſynode to impoſe lawes vpon him? Thus much ſhall ſuffice to be ſpoken in defenſe of thoſe later diſciplinarians, from whom (although in ſome thinges I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe I diſſent) yet I cannot coſent to the D. taking away of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency. Wherein we ſee how the more he ſtriveth, to remove the title of popelings from the dioceſan or provinciall Biſhop; the more he inwrappeth either the one or the other, vnder a juſt and due ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle therevnto. And ſince it is, and ſhalbe proved, that he giveth both <note place="margin">The D. get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by ſtriving, &amp; let him take home his plaine lye.</note> ſole and ſupreme authority to Biſhops in their Churches; he muſt (will he nill he) take home to himſelf, that ſame plaine-lye, which he giveth his Refuter (in the next ſection. pag. 47.) becauſe he ſaith, <hi>that his wordes doe there imply (and afterwards plainely affirme) a ſovereigntie and ſupremacie in Biſhops over other Miniſters;</hi> for in the Refuters vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, <hi>ſovereigntie,</hi> is nothing but ſole and ſupreme authority. What more there is, the Refuter is content to ſaye, (as the D. in the ſection following,) willeth him to ſay in another caſe, <hi>ou manthano,</hi>

D.</note> ſpent to litle purpoſe, the Doctors cheife drift is to cleare himſelf of ſome vntruthes, which the Refuter chargeth vpon him in his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, <hi>that the wiſe and learned diſciplinarians doe grant, 1. that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops which in his text are called Angels, were Biſhops of whole cities and the countreies adioyning, that is to ſay, Dioceſes. 2. That the Preſbyters which were no Miniſters were lay and annuall. 3. That theſe angels were nothing elſe but Preſidents of the Preſbyteries. 4. That their preſidentſhip, was one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for a week or a month, and that by courſe, as being comon to them in their turnes.</hi> Now the Doctor, to manifeſt the truth to be of his ſide, in all theſe points, appealeth to the writings of Calvin and Beza. And touching the firſt, the ſheweth from their words, that in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church, Biſhops had the overſight of Dioceſes; and therefore in ſome places (where their circuit was very large) they had vnder them, ſuch as were called <hi>Chorepiſcopi,</hi> countrey-Biſhops (he might have added Lectores, Acoluthes &amp;c.) &amp; that they had alſo above them <hi>Metropolitanes,</hi> as we may ſee in the places whereunto he ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs. Calv.

                     <p>But how doth this prove (that which he was to prove), that the <note place="margin">The D. fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not himſelf fro the untru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon him.</note> 
                        <hi>Biſhops</hi> which in his text are called <hi>angels,</hi> were Biſhops of Dioceſes, or ſet over whole cities and the countryes adjoyning? Doth it not prove as ſtrongly, that theſe angels had both country-Biſhops, &amp; diverſe other inferior degrees of clergie-men vnder them; and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitans above them? Which if the Doct. ſhould affirme, his beſt freinds would ſee very evidently, that he abuſeth theſe grave and <note place="margin">The Doct. changeth the queſt:, &amp; concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth that which would co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince him of 2. evils.</note> learned divines moſt groſſely, to make them the authors of thoſe vntruthes, which himſelf broached, and will not recall. His hope was (it ſeemeth) to blinde his readers eyes, by a crafty changing of the queſtion (as almoſt every where he doth) and concealing that which ſerveth to convince him, both of mainteyning an vntruth, and abuſing their teſtimonies to mainteyne it. For it is manifeſt, that they both do ſpeak neyther of theſe <hi>Angels,</hi> nor of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles times; but of that forme of government, which by humane
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:14068:61"/> ordinance tooke place after their daies; wherein the ordinances of Chriſte and his Apoſtles, which ſhould have bin kept inviolable (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to 1.

Wherefore the points de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced out of the text, cannot exceed the number of foure; ſo that in the Doctors enumerating of 5. concluſions to be more at large proſecuted; the nomber of theſe later excedeth the nomber of the former by one, as every childe knoweth that can tell his 5. fingers.

That which followeth as a conſequent of this, (viz. <hi>that the Angels of the Churches and preſidents of the preſbyteries, were not pariſhonall but dioceſan Biſhops.)</hi> muſt be referred to the Biſhops, that lived in the firſt 200 yeares after Chriſt; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the anſwere of the ſecond queſtion hath peculier reference to the Angels of the 7. churches, that they were not pariſhonall but dioceſan Biſhops. 3.

                     <p>As for that faire floriſhe which he maketh, for the bringing of the firſt foure to the proofe of the firſt aſſertion; and the laſte of the five, to the fortifyinge of the ſecond; how vainly he ſtriveth therin, the very change of both the aſſertions before named and here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, doth ſufficiently declare: yet his defect herein, ſhall more fully be layd open hereafter, vpon juſt occaſion offred.</p>

It is a truth, by himſelf confeſſed in the laſt ſection of this chapter (pag. 57. lin. 33. &amp; 35.) that the body or frame of his ſermon concludeth one and the ſame queſtion; but he is very angrie with his Refuter for reducing both the aſſertions, which he propoſed to be diſtinctly handled, into one ſyllogiſme. For though he granteth that ſome ſuch ſyllogiſme, as his Refuter framed, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <pb n="118" facs="tcp:14068:66"/> quarrel againſt his refuter is yet behinde, namely, the cenſure which he paſſeth upon thoſe 5. points which he proſecuted in the body of his ſermon, where he ſaith (anſw. pag. 9.) that the firſt &amp; the laſt are to litle purpoſe, and that the other three doe not dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly prove the point in queſtion. I will not here trouble the reader with the Doctors termes, wherein he ſheweth in what rage he was hereat; let us rather examine how juſt or vnjuſt this the Refuters cenſure is; the which that it may appeare, let it be remembred that the Doctor acknowledgeth (in the former ſection pag. 54) that the firſt 4. points muſt be referred to the proof of his firſt aſſertion; &amp; the laſt of the fyve, to the ſecond. Now this being ſo, whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver taketh his ſecond aſſertion, in the words wherein he delivered it (ſerm. pag. 2.) ſhall eaſily diſcerne, that it is labour beſtowed in vaine, to ſpend time in the proving of that, which is cleare enough of it ſelf. For who ever doubted, but that the office and function of thoſe Biſhops, which are in his text meant by angels, is there approved as lawful and commended as excellent? Wherefore, if his 5. point, ſerve for none other vſe, then for the proofe of this <note place="margin">The D. 5. point is idle.</note> aſſertion; the D. hath no cauſe to blame his Ref: for affirming he might well have ſpared that labour.

Be it therefore knowne to him, that he reaſoneth abſurdly, if he <note place="margin">The D. rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoneth ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdly.</note> referr his 5. point to the fortifying of his 2. aſſertion, (pag. 2.) for thus then his enthymeme ſtandeth. <hi>The calling of Biſhops, ſuch as ours are, or at leaſt ſuch as the Biſhops of the auncient Churches are affirmed to be (ſerm. pag. 7.) is of apoſtolical and divine institution. Ergo the function of Biſhops meant by angels. (Apoc. 1, 20.) is in the ſame text approved as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and commended as excellent.</hi> As for that difference which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the later terme or praedicatum of the antecedent, and of the conſequent in this argument, I will take no exception againſt it; for though every apoſtolicall or divine inſtitution findeth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation in this text Apocal. 1. 20; yet the honour of ſuch an inſtitution cannot be denied vnto any function, which in this text receiveth approbation. Wherefore, he ſhall with good leave (if he will) exchange the later terme of his concluſion thus, <hi>Ergo the function of Biſhops meant by Angels (Apoc. 1. 20.) is of apoſtolicall and divine inſtitution.</hi> But how will the D. cover the ſhame, of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly reaſoning; when in ſtead of juſtifying our Biſhops, by the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:14068:66"/> calling of thoſe Angels; he doth contrariwiſe, inferre their calling to be of divine inſtitution, becauſe our biſhops have deryved their function, from divine or apoſtolicall ordination? Is not this to ſet the Cart before the Horſe, &amp; to laye that for the foundation, which <note place="margin">The D. lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that for the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, that ſhould ſerve for the ridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pole.</note> ſhould ſerve for the roofe or higheſt parte of his buylding? It will not ſerve his turne to tell us, that we miſtake his. 2. Aſſertion; for it is already ſhewed, that himſelf putteth a changling in place thereof, when he delivereth vnder that name this concluſion; <hi>that callinge of dioceſan Biſhops is lawfull and good.</hi> Notwithſtanding ſince he will needes have this, (which the falſely calleth his 2. Aſſertion) to be the doctrine whlch he intended to prove (not onely by the explication of his text, comprized in his firſt aſſertion, but alſo) by that 5. point, wherein he beſtowed his greateſt labour: if he have ſufficiently fortified the former 4. pointes, which ſerve to vpholde that explication which concludeth his doctrine; what offence was it for his Refuter then, or now againe for his reader, to ſay, that his labour in the laſt point was needleſſe, and might well have bin ſpared? May he not well think, that one argument ſoundly conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the canonicall text, will more prevaile with the wiſe, then many conjectural reaſons, drawne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mere humane teſtimonies? But may a man prove his patience yet a little further, &amp; that with an harder ſentence. viz. That he contradicteth himſelf, in urging <note place="margin">The D. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And who ſo well obſerveth, what lawfulnes and goodnes or excellencie, he aſcribeth, eyther to the function of thoſe Biſhops, which are meant by angels in his text (aſſert. 2. pag. 2. or to the calling of all other Biſhops anſwerable to his deſcription; (pag. 51. with 54. &amp; 54.) he may plainly perceive, that it is no other then ſuch as hath inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution from God, and approbation from the text it ſelf under the names of <hi>ſtarrs</hi> &amp; <hi>angels;</hi> wherefore if he himſelf had beene as care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to obſerve the tranſitions, which he vſeth in his ſermon; as he is ready without cauſe, to blame his refuter for not obſerving the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>;

                     <p>As for the firſt 4. pointes, how pertinent or impertinent they are, ſhalbe beſt perceived if we examine, how he himſelf reduceth them <note place="margin">Sect. 4. ad pag. 57. 58.</note> to his purpoſe. But let the reader be firſt advertiſed of the D. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy in laying downe his owne project, whereat he aymed in in his ſermon. For 1. when he promiſeth (ſerm. page. 2.) in the handling of the wordes of his text, to prove, both <hi>what manner of perſons are there ment by the Angels, &amp; what is the qualitie of their function;</hi>

Yet now in his defenſe he every where reſtreineth the explication of his text, vnto the former aſſertion. 2. And having firſt altered the later (as he doth the former alſo as is before ſhewed) he conſtantly commendeth it to us, as the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of his ſermon; whereas his owne wordes (pag. 93. of the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Againe, though he will at no hand conſent to his Refuter plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, in caſting both his aſſertions into one ſyllogiſme, as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes, from which the lawfullnes of the function, of our Engliſh prela<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Yea he himſelfe is inforced (though he pretend the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary) to vſe them both for the premiſſes, which in his firſt ſyllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſme (Defenc. pag. 58.) doe conclude his newe doctrine. <note place="margin">The D. ſermon &amp; the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſe there of are at variance. yea within 20. lines he diſagreeth with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</note>

                        </gap>inct ſyllogiſms concluding the ſame queſtion: who would not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that the concluſion of each ſyllogiſm, ſhould be a point dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from both his aſſertions before diſtinguiſhed; and that as the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:14068:67"/> former aſſertion is the aſſumption of his firſt ſyllogiſm: ſo the later alſo ſhould be the aſſumption of the ſecond? But it is farr other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; for the later of his two diſtinct partes or aſſertions mentioned in his defenſe, is the concluſion of both his ſyllogiſmes; and the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of his ſecond ſyllogiſm, is the laſt of his 5. pointes, which by his firſt and trueſt reckoninge, was the maine-doctrine of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; and therefore ought to have bin the finall concluſion, vnto which the body of his ſermon is to be reduced. Wherefore it is not to be doubted, but that (when the D. hath adviſedly conſidered of theſe things) in his next defenſe he will be well content to give the later of his two ſyllogiſmes a faire bill of diſcharge, rather then to mainteine it any longer in that ſervice, wherevnto he hath now aſſigned it.</p>
                     <p>As for his former ſyllogiſm, though I altogither miſlike it not, if the aſſumption and concluſion be vnderſtood of all kinde of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oceſan Biſhops; (for elſe, though it conteineth the greater parte of his ſermon, yet doth it not ſo much as conclude the queſtion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the calling of ſome kinde of dioceſan Biſhops maie be lawfull and good, though not the calling of ſuch a kinde as ours are whoſe defenſe the D. intendeth) and if theſe wordes <hi>lawfull and good</hi> be ſo taken as he vnderſtandeth them (ſerm. pag. 2. 54. 55.) viz. <hi>for that which hath inſtitution and approbation from God, or is in his word approved as lawfull and good:</hi> yet to avoid further quarrels about words, I wiſh that his concluſion carry the very wordes of his doctrine, or ſuch as are apparantly equivalent vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. In which reſpect, (if I might be ſo bolde as to lende the D. adviſe in this matter) I ſuppoſe his ſyllogiſm might very well ſtand in this forme.</p>
                     <p>The function of Biſhops ment by Angels Apoc. 1. 20. is of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolicall, or of divine inſtitution, or is approved in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as lawfull and good.</p>
                     <p>But the function of Biſhops (ſuch as ours are for the ſubſtance of their callinge) is the verie function of thoſe Biſhops which are ment by Angels, Apoc. 1. 20. Therefore the function of Biſhops (ſuch as ours are for the ſubſtance of their callinge,) is of apoſtolicall or divine inſtitution: or is approved in the holy Scriptures as lawfull and good.</p>
                     <p>Of this ſyllogiſm, as the concluſion ſuteth well with the laſt of his 5. pointes, which he calleth (ſerm. pag. 7. 55. 93.) his doctrine:
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:14068:68"/> ſo the premiſſes doe agree with thoſe two aſſertions, which conteine the explication of his text (pag. 2.) to wit, the propoſition with the ſecond, and the aſſumption with the firſt.</p>

The propoſition (which he ſaith he did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe) is in effect all one with the later of his 2. aſſertions (ſerm. <note place="margin">The D. tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth 3. vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truthes in one ſyllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſm.</note> pag. 2.) for there is no other difference betwixt them, then this, that here their callinge is more at large affirmed <hi>to be lawfull &amp; good;</hi> whereas there, he ſpeaketh within a narrower compaſſe, that their function is in this text (then handled) <hi>approved as lawfull and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as excellent.</hi> Which difference with him, is none at all, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (though now he hath forgotten it) he acknowledgeth (in this chap. (ſect. 5. pag. 35.) his ſecond aſſertion to be this, viz. <hi>that the calling of Biſhops, who are here ment by Angels, is lawfull and good.</hi> 2. As for his aſſumption (which he ſaith is the ſame with the firſt aſſertio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) it herein differreth from it; that it ſetteth <hi>di ceſan Biſhops</hi> in ſtede of theſe wordes, <hi>ſuch Biſhops as ours are for the ſubſtance of their callinge.</hi> And whoſo obſerveth that for the deciding of his firſt queſtion (which affirmeth the Angels of the 7. churches to be ſuch Biſhops as ours are) he vndertaketh to trie (pag. 3.) whether thoſe Angels were pariſhional or dioceſan Biſhops; he ſhall finde that his firſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, doth crave the help of his aſſumption, to ſtand in the place of one of the pillers that muſt ſupport it.</p>
                     <p>And touching his concluſion, ſince he tolde us, (even in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer page) that it is the very concluſion which he propoſed to be proved, (ſerm. pag. 55.) why ſaith he nowe, he did not expreſſe it? And if it be the main doctrin of his ſermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (as every where through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his defenſe he affirmeth) why ſaith he it is onely implied in the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:14068:68"/> collection of his doctrine out of the text? But no more of theſe <hi>whies,</hi> let us come to the maine queſtion, (from which the reader hath bin held too longe) I meane the triall of the truth of the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, and how true it is, <hi>that it is (as he ſaith) proved by the 4. firſt pointes of his five.</hi>

For every man certeinly ſeeth that it is every waie as doubtfull (for ought appeareth to the contrary by his text) whether the Angels therein ſpoken of, were dioceſan Biſhops; as whether the calling of dioceſan Biſhops be lawfull and good. And it ſemeth that himſelf diſcerned ſome defect in his proofe; ſeing he forbeareth to deliver it in ſyllogiſticall forme of reaſoninge, (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in otherwiſe he is not ſparinge) for he hath no other ſyllogiſm that bendeth this waie, then ſuch as ariſe from each of his 4. pointes <note place="margin">Nether one alone nor all the D. 4. points togither doe direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude his aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

For the firſt aſſertion (propounded ſerm pag. 2.) with which he accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his aſſumption, determineth no other queſtion then this, viz. <hi>who and what manner of perſons are ment by the Churches?</hi> But the aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which his 4. pointes doe conclude, is (as his owne wordes teach in the next chapter pag. 60.) the anſwere of another queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to witt, <hi>whether the premitive Churches were governed by ſuch dioceſan Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops as ours are, or by ſuch preſbyteries as we ſpeake of?</hi> This later is a queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>de facto,</hi> examininge what forme of government was imbraced

Notwithſtanding the D. will at no hand conſent that the preſbyters, (of whom Paul ſpeaketh Actes 20. 28.) ſhould be dioceſan Biſhops, ſuch as ours are; for he taketh them for inferiour Miniſters, ſuch as he will have to be called <hi>Preiſtes.</hi> Now if he reply that the Churches practiſe in ſucceding ages, allowinge vnto Biſhops thoſe priviledges before mencioned, helpeth nothing to prove, that thoſe wordes of the text, doe conveye the ſame partes or notes of epiſcopall prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, vnto the Presbyters or Biſhops there ſpoken of; why may not the Refuter return him the ſame anſwere, viz. That all his proofes produced to confirme his opinion touching the dioceſan juriſdiction and preheminent ſuperiority of the Biſhops, which go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned the ancient Churches, doe neyther directly nor neceſſarily conclude that ſuch dioceſan Biſhops, are to be vnderſtood by the Angels of the Churches Apoc. 1. 20? For is not the holy Scripture ſufficient to interpret it ſelfe? Or are the rules which divines doe generally imbrace for the interpretation of any text, as by waying all circumſtances of the text it ſelf; &amp; comparinge other Scriptures with it, where the like wordes or phraſes are uſed; are theſe rules I ſay too weake or too ſhort, to make good that large and powerfull preheminence, which he aſſigneth to theſe Angels? If so; may we not juſtly ſuſpecte his explication to be forced and vnfitting? If o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe; why doth he not indeavour to ſhewe, that his conſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the text he handleth, is conſonant to the circumſtances, and to other ſcriptures? There be many words in the ſcripture, which may be drawne (as the Canon-lawe ſayth diſt. 37. relatum) to that ſenſe which every one for the nonce, will frame to himſelf: But it ſhould not be ſo: for we muſt not from without them, ſeek a foreigne and ſtrange ſenſe; that ſo we may, as we can, confirme it, with the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the text; but the meaning of the truth muſt be received, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſcriptures themſelves.

And the untruth of his ſecond, is no leſſe evident; for as the diſtribution of his ſermon, &amp; the tranſitions vſed therein, doe wholly diſſagree, from his whole analyſis here propounded; (as is before obſerved) ſo they doe juſtify his refuter againſt himſelf, not onely in the premiſſes of his firſt ſyllogiſme; (which agree with his

And though now he make a faire ſhewe, of reducing the firſt of his 5. pointes, to prove his firſt aſſertion <hi>anaskevaſticos,</hi> by diſproving the presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries which we deſire; yet even this very defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſe he maketh for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, clearely juſtifieth his Refuter that ſayd, he could not ſee how it did directly prove that aſſertion the proofe whereof he ſearched af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

Wherefore, for an anſwere to his queſtion, (which he tendered for his firſt reaſon) it may ſuffice to demande the like of him, that is, how he could perſwade himſelfe, that his <hi>analyſis</hi> here delivered, was anſwerable to the <hi>geneſis</hi> or firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of his ſermon; when he ſawe (or at leaſt wiſe mought have ſeene) that 4. parts of his five, doe not conclude his firſt aſſertion, and that the fift could not be brought to his frame, without a change of the doctrine firſt propounded in his ſermon?

The firſt queſtion, he ſaith his handled in the former part of his ſermon; to which he reduceth his 4. firſt points. And the ſecond in the later, which is the laſt of his five. And thus in deed, I graunt, that every of his 5. points may be pertinent to his purpoſe: yet ſtill I affirme, that if they be referred to the proof of his two aſſertions, which he ought by his promiſe (ſerm. pag. 2.) to prove; the firſt and laſt might well have bene ſpared; and the other three (not to repeat againe, how one of them at the leaſt, is needleſſe) doe neyther directly, nor neceſſarily conclude that firſt aſſertion, which he ſaith is proved by them. Wherefore, had he meant to frame his analyſis, to ſuch a diſtribution, as beſt agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with his Geneſis; we ſhould never have heard: from him, (that which ſo often he repeateth in this defence, to wit) that his five points enumerated pag. 6. 7. are the direct proofes of his 2. aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, propoſed pag. 2: he would rather have divided that part of his preface, which himſelfe (ſect. 1. of this chapter) calleth the propoſition, into theſe two members. 1. a propoſition of certeine queſtions to be debated for the explication of his text, (pag. 2. 3. &amp; 5.) which he promiſeth to cleare, but doth not. 2. a digreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

This had bene both true &amp; plaine dealing, but he was not willing, the world ſhould ſee, that his text affoardeth him ſo litle help as it doth, to conclude the doctrine, which he pretendeth to ariſe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation thereof.

Moreover, in the 2. queſtion as he hath propoſed it, who would not thinke, both that all which plead for presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries (whether ſeverall in every pariſhe, or one in diverſe) doe holde

Wherefore ſince the Doctor ſuſteyning the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the opponent, in this diſputation, beginneth with the firſt

So that if I would treade in the D. ſtepps. I might juſtly repay him with ſome ſuch marginall notes as (pag 47. &amp; 53.) without cauſe, he hath ſett down to diſgrace his Refuter: to witt, that the D. and his Conſorts at this Day, doe pleade againſt the diſcipline, which Arch-Biſhop Whitgift &amp; other learned Proteſtants (yea the moſt ancient freinds of the Hierarchy) acknowledged to be practiſed in the apoſtolike Churches; and that the Doctor miſtaking the queſtion, and craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily concealing the diviſion, that is among them of his owne ſide; is bold to affirme that to be graunted, which he knoweth to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied.</p>

In deed when the Refuter intended to ſhewe, that our dioceſan Biſhops maye be proved abſolute popelings, by the ſame reaſon that the D. urgeth to caſt that name on the pariſhe Biſhops, for which, they whom the D. calleth a new ſecte, doe (as he ſaith) ſtryve; he then affirmed that the queſtion betwixt the Doctor and them, (not betwene the D. and us, for thoſe words the D. hath evilly put in, to make his owne cauſe good) was this, <hi>whether the Churches ſhould be governed by Paſtors,</hi>

Shall I therfore now inferr, that he contradicteth himſelf, in ſaying that his aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is falſified in the later part of the queſtion?</p>
                     <p>4. But what need ſo many words to thewe the weaknes of the Doctors diſiunctive argumentation, or to prove that there is not
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:14068:76"/> any preſuppoſed truth in his diſiunctive propoſition? I hope he wil graunt (for he is a Doctor, and cannot (lightly) ſo farr forget his logick rules, but he muſt knowe) that the queſtion, which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bateth in the firſt part of his ſermon, muſt holde proportion with that aſſertion, which is to be concluded from the 4. firſt points of his five; ſeing the firſt part of his ſermon is comprehended in them. Now the aſſertion, which is to be proved by theſe 4. pointes, is ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this which his diſiunctive argument concludeth, viz. <hi>that the primitive Churches were governed by Dioceſan Biſhops;</hi> or rather, that which before he ſet downe (pag. 58.) for the aſſumption of his firſt ſyllogiſme, viz. <hi>that Dioceſan Biſhops are ſuch as are here meant by angels.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But which ſoever of theſe two, he chooſeth, certeine it is, his que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion <note place="margin">Sect. 4.</note> wil not yeeld him any ſuch diſiunctive propoſition, as he now draweth from this which he tendreth. For his quaeſtion muſt be a ſingle one, and not compounded of two members, viz eyther this, <hi>whether the primitive Church was governed by Dioceſan Biſhops or no?</hi> or rather this, <hi>whether Dioceſan Biſhops, be vnderstood by the angels or no?</hi> And this laſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth ſomewhat neare the mark, though it miſſe of the right tenour of wordes which it ought to have kept. viz. <hi>whether Biſhops meant by angels in his text, were ſuch Biſhops for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of their calling, as are our Biſhops at this day?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And thus we may ſee what moved the Doctor to change his firſt queſtion, and how litle he gaineth thereby; ſeing he cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe his deſire of dravving the firſt point of his five, to conclude that aſſertion, to which he referred the firſt part of his ſermon. Wherefore, ſeing his diſiunctive argumentation will not ſerve his turne; and he will yet once againe, (for it ſeemeth he is vnwea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore I hope, he will at length, acknowledge his paſſage, concerning governing el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, to be altogither impertinent; for (to pay him with his owne coyne pag. 60.) co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſenſe requireth, that what he ſeeth imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, he ſhould acknowledge ſo to be; &amp; charitie would (though ſelfe-love would not) that if he diſcerned not the untruth, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſequence of his reaſoning; he ſhould rather have ſuſpected his owne analyſis to be forced, then have blamed his Refuter, for his owne want of judgement.</p>

And to this, he reduceth all the arguments layd downe by him in the handlinge of his fift poſition, which he calleth the later part of his ſermon; and from this he inferreth thoſe three vſes which he would have us all to make conſcience of, viz. <hi>To acknowledge their function to be the ordinance of God, and in that regard, both to reverence their perſons; and to obey their authority, as we are exhorted.

                     <p>If this concluſion doth not neceſſarily followe upon the Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent; then the Doctor (if he ſhut not his right eye) may ſee the looſenes of his owne argument.

Neyther would the Doctor feare to profeſſe that our Biſhops doe governe Monarchically, or by their ſole authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, ſave that he foreſeeth (as it ſeemeth lib. 3. pag. 22) that if he ſhould plainly aſcribe unto them a ſole power of ordination and juriſdiction; it might be thence inferred that he alloweth no juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to Presbyters, and holdeth thoſe Churches to have no law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Miniſters, which have not ſuch Biſhops as ours are to ordeyne them. And ſurely (though he falſly charge his Refuter for diſgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing his ſermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with thoſe inferences, yet) if he have none other way to avoyd them, but by denying that he giveth vnto Biſhops, a ſole power of ordination and juriſdiction; he muſt be content hereafter to beare this imputation, that he giveth way to thoſe abſurdities he would ſeeme to diſclayme.</p>
                     <p>For firſt, touching juriſdiction, ſince he placeth it in that ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and peereleſſe power of rule (before ſpoken of ſect. 7.) which <note place="margin">Sect. 9.</note> admitteth no partner, and ſubjecteth all, both presbyters and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in foro externo, to his direction as their ruler, and to his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection as their judge: that which is already preſſed to prove a ſole ſuperiority, or ſole power of rule in Biſhops, doth directly ſerve to conclude a ſole power of juriſdiction in them. For to ſpeake (as he doth) of externall &amp; publike juriſdiction, in foro externo, which ſtandeth (as he ſaith ſerm. pag. 51.) <hi>in receyving accuſations, in conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting parties accuſed, and cenſuring ſuch as are found guilty, accordinge to the quality of the offence, by reproofe, putting to ſilence, ſuſpenſion, deprivation, or excommunication;</hi> in which reſpect, ſeing all the presbyters within the dioceſe are ſubiect to the Biſhop (yea even thoſe that ſhould aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſte him, aſwell as others that are ſevered from him, and affixed to their ſeverall cures) it is apparrant, that that majority of rule, which the D. giveth him over all, cannot be leſſe then a ſole power of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction. For who can deny a ſole power of juriſdiction to him, that is, in the power and exerciſe thereof, ſo lifted vp aboue all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, in an whole dioceſe, that they are all in ſubjection vnto him, and he hath no aſſiſtantes to reſtreyne him?

                     <p>Secondly, concerninge ordination, the reader is to be advertiſed that he ſaith (ſerm. pag. 37.) <hi>it hath bin a receyved opinion in the Church of God, even from the Apoſtles times vntill our age, that the right of ordinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of preſbyters is ſuch a peculiar prerogative of Biſhops, as that ordinarily and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly, there could be no lawfull ordination, but by a Biſhop.</hi> And addeth (pag. 40.) that the perpetuall conſent of the Church of God, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriateth <hi>the ordinary right of ordination to the Biſhop alone.</hi> And (pag. 42.) that Biſhops <hi>onely, in the judgment of the Fathers have right of orde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge Miniſters, regularly.</hi> And therefore, though extraordinarily and in caſe of neceſſity, he ſeeme to allowe of their Miniſtery, which in the want of a Biſhop, are ordeyned by other Miniſters; yet this is no other allowance, then he giveth to the baptiſme of women or laie-perſons, in the want of a Miniſter. For he ſaith in plaine terms (pag. 44.) <hi>The truth is, where Miniſters maye be had, none but Miniſters ought to baptize; and where Byſhops maye be had, none but Byſhops ought to ordeyne.</hi> In which words, who ſeeth not, that the ref: hath ſufficient ground to affirme, that the D. giveth to Biſhops a ſole power of ordination? If he will ſay (as he ſeemeth to perſwade lib. 3. pag. 69.) that this argueth onely a <hi>ſuperiority</hi> in the power of ordeyning and not a ſole power; then let him alſo profeſſe plainly, that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters have not any ſole power of baptiſing, but onely a ſuperiority
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:14068:81"/> in that power, above women or other laie-perſons.</p>
                     <p>But he cannot thus evade, though he would, ſeing (lib. 3. pag. 105.) he expreſly affimeth, <hi>that the power of impoſing hands to conveigh grace, either to parties baptized for their confirmation; or to panitents for their reconciliation, or to parties deſigned to the Miniſtery, for their ordination, is peculiar vnto Biſhops, and to the power of their order, whereby they differ from Preſbyters and Deacons</hi> yea, this power of <hi>ordeyning</hi> is (in his conceite pag. 106.) <hi>ſo appropriated to the power of order in Biſhops, that they cannot communicate it to any others.</hi> Wherefore though he ſhould never ſo impudently ſtand forth to mainteine that he doth not aſcribe a ſole power of ordinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to them; yet wil it be inevitably concluded fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his owne wordes. For, whoſoever have the right or power of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation appropriated to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alone, as a prerogative peculiar to their function, and that by the power of their order, yea ſo peculiar to their order, that they cannot communicate it to men of another function; they muſt needes have the ſole power of ordination. If therfore Biſhops have the power of ordination, ſo appropriated to them alone and to the power of their order; (as is before ſhewed from the D. owne wordes) it followeth of neceſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

This is alſo implied in thoſe ſpeaches ſo often repeated (lib. 3. pag. 72. 86. 93. 97.) <hi>that the power of ordeyninge was in the Biſhops, and not in the preſbyters;</hi> And <hi>that Biſhops had the power or right</hi> of ordeyning, <hi>which preſbyters had not.</hi> And of ordination and juriſdiction jointly, as he conſtantly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth them, to be the principall and moſt eſſentiall parts of the epiſcopall authority: (lib. 3. pag. 68. &amp; lib. 4. pag. 78.) ſo he flatly denyed the charge of theſe affaires, to belonge vnto presbyters <note place="margin">The Doct. muſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And in this ſenſe the ſuperiority of Biſhops, over other inferior Miniſters, maye be called de jure divino, or an ordinance divine. Doctor Sutcliff: (de presb: cap. 15.) preſſeth among other argumentes <hi>apoſtolorum uſum et morem,</hi> to prove that the ſuperiority of Biſhops above other Miniſters doth niti jure di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vino.

(as the D. himſelf doth lib. 3. pag. 116.) and are not ſo ſcrupulous (as the D. is) to allowe that the ſuperiority of their function is warranted to them jure divino.

Yea it ſeemeth, that when the D. preached his former ſermon of the dignity and duty of the Miniſters; either he had not yet learned, or at leaſt, he little regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded this diſtinction. For (pag. 73.) he taketh an ordinance deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the Apoſtle 1.

                     <p>But let us come (as neere as we can) to his author of this diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: Bellarmin in deed, diſtinguiſheth betwene jus divinum and Apoſtolicum, atfirming (lib. de clericis cap. 18.) that the mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of preiſts, is prohibired, onely jure apoſtolico, not divino. Quod enim, ſaith he, Apoſtolus praecipit, non divinum, ſed apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicum praeceptum eſt. But with him, jus apoſtolicum, is no other then jus humanum, or poſitivum. Ibid. &amp; cap. ſeq:. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, he urgeth the ſame diſtinction (as the D. acknowledgeth (lib. 3. pag. 101.) to ſhewe, what he tooke to be Hieroms meaning, when he ſaith that a Biſhop differeth from a Presbyter, in nothing, ſave in the power of ordination, that is, ſaith he, (lib. de Clericis cap. 15.) in this onely he is ſuperiour to other Miniſters ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re divino; but in the power or juriſdiction, jure apoſtolico. Which diſtinction, though in this place the Doctor admitteth not; yet elſewhere (lib. 3. pag. 26.) he alloweth it to reconcile thoſe ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Ierom (ad Euagr: and in Tit. cap. 1. where he denieth the ſuperioritie of Biſhops, to be of divine diſpoſition; &amp; yet affirmeth it to be an apoſtolical tradition. <hi>He may be vnderſtood</hi> (ſaith the D.) <hi>as holding their ſuperioutie to be, not divini, but apoſtolici juris.</hi> But how ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he accord with Bellarmin in approving the diſtinction: yet ſince he holdeth the epiſcopall ſuperiority, to be ſo farre forth a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ordinance as it proceeded from God, in aſmuch as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were directed by the holy Ghoſt in ordeyning it: he cannot (without apparant contradiction to himſelf) imbrace Bellarmins <note place="margin">The D. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

That the authoritie, yea the function and authority, which they had (conſiſting ſpecially in the power of ordination and juriſdiction) was not to dye with their perſons but to be continued in their ſuceſſors (ſermon. pag. 75. 79. Defence lib. 3. pag. 72. &amp; lib. 4. pag. 84. 98. and 100). That the commandements and injunctions given them, to be kept inviolable vntil the appearing of Chriſt; were directed to them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone and their ſucceſſors (ſerm. pag. 49. 74.) And that the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties preſcribed for the execution of their office &amp; authoritie, were to be performed by them and their ſucceſſors till the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of Chriſt (lib. 4. pag. 77.) And which is yet more he addeth, that their ſucceſſors were Biſhops onely, yea Dioceſan Biſhops: (ſerm. pag. 75. lib. 4. pag. 85.) and that, not <hi>de facto</hi> onely, but alſo <hi>de iure.</hi> (Ibid.) And that Presbyters neither were nor could be their ſucceſſors. (lib. 3. pag. 73.) and that neither are thoſe inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons given in generall to presbyters; neyther doth the charge of thoſe affaires belong unto them. (lib. 4. pag. 79.) Wherefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo he affirmeth, or rather from the premiſes concludeth, that the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:14068:87"/> epiſtles written to Timothy and Titus, were the very patterns and preſidents of the epiſcopall function, and purpoſely written to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme not Timothy and Titus alone, but them and their ſucceſſors (viz. all Biſhops) to the worlds end, how to exerciſe their function. (ſerm. pag. 72. 73. Defence lib. 4. pag. 75. 83.) Yea and further ſaith, that thoſe precepts, 1.

That according to the rules of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Church-government, as the right of adminiſtring baptiſme, is a peculiar prerogative of the miniſteriall function jure divino, by the lawe of God; ſo eodem jure, even by the ſame lawe, the right of ordination is peculiar to the Biſhops. And as all Churches un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der heaven, till the comming of Chriſt to judgement, are bound to ſtrive for the eſtabliſhing &amp; reteyning of that Miniſterie, which God hath authorized to adminiſter baptiſme: ſo are all Churches by a like band tied to contend for the epiſcopall function, which hath right to ordeyne. And conſequently the calling of Biſhops for ordeyning is as generally, perpetually, and immutablie neceſſarie, as the office of other Miniſters is, for the work of baptiſme. I add,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:14068:88"/> that, in the D. opinion, there is as perpetuall and immutable a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie of the epiſcopal function for the ordering of every Church; as there is (in the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of many very judicious divines) of wine, for the holy and pure adminiſtration of the Lords ſupper.

It had bin eaſy for him, to have diſioyned their function from their authority, in his whole ſpeach on this manner. q. d. But neyther was the function which Tim. and Tit. had at Epheſus and in Crete, to ende with their perſons, as being ordinary: neyther was their authority to dye with them, as being perpetually neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry &amp;c. Therefore had he ſo ment in deed and truth, as he now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth, ſince there wanted not skill; there muſt needs be in him a wante of will, to ſpeake plainely vnto the capacity of his reader; <note place="margin">The Doct. is guilty of that impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, which he profeſſeth to abhorr.</note> ſo that he ſtandeth here guilty of that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>2. Moreover, if he will vouchſafe to peruſe his Defenſe (lib. 4. pag. 97 98.) he may perceive, that as his purpoſe was by a newe ſupply of arguments (as he ſaith) to prove that Timothy and Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus were Biſhops: ſo his maine argument there ſet downe conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, the very function of Timothy and Titus to be ordinarie and epiſcopall, becauſe it was not extraordinarie and Evangelicall. For although (to conforme his firſt argument to his proſyllogiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>3. But if he will needs begin with that diſiunction, with which he endeth; he ſhall fall into a twofolde abſurdity, which he cannot avoid, viz. an untoward laying downe of the queſtion, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning; and a ſhameleſſe begging of the queſtion, in the end. For neyther doe they hold the function onely of Timothy and Titus to be ordinarie, or their authoritie onely to be epiſcopall: neyther doe the Diſciplinarians teach their function onely to be extraordinary, and their authoritie onely to be evangelicall: but rather affirme, their function to be both extraordinarie and evangelicall; as in the propoſition of his firſt ſyllogiſme he confeſſeth. And as for their authoritie vnderſtanding thereby (as the Doctor doth) nothing elſe but a power to ordeyne and to exerciſe a publik ſpirituall juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction: they doe no where affirme it to be eyther extraordinarie or proper to an Evangeliſt. Yea the Doctor acknowledgeth (pag. 84. and 100.) that his Refuter graunteth, that others were to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cced Timothy and Titus in the authoritie which they had; but not in their office; and that their authoritie (though not their functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) was perpetually neceſſarie.

In like manner when he affirmeth (pag. 69.) that in the Apoſtles times the Churches were not divided into ſeveral pariſhes, his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning muſt be this and no other. q. d. In the Apoſtles times, the Churches were no Dioceſes. Which is to contradict and condemn
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:14068:98"/> of falſhood, the very maine aſſertion, which in the ſecond parte of his ſermon, he vndertooke to prove. And when he argueth there in this manner <hi>(The Churches in the Apoſtles times were not divided into ſeverall pariſhes; and therefore the preſbyteries in their dayes were appointed not to pariſhes but to Dioceſes)</hi> his purpoſe is to reaſon very profoundly to this effect. q. d. in the Apoſtles times, there were no Dioceſes: &amp; therefore in their times the Presbyteries were appointed vnto Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oceſes. Behold we, what the Doctor hath gayned in avouching his Refuters reaſon, to be nothing elſe but a deniall of the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Are not the conſequences of this aſſertion cleare evidences that it is himſelfe that is confounded; and that writeth againſt his conſcience, as one reſolved not to be perſwaded, though his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience be convicted?</p>
                     <p>2. For (to returne to the point in hand) as the D. knoweth well enough, that his Refuters words are bent againſt the conſequence of his argument: for his meaning is clearely nothing elſe then this, q. d. though it could be proved that every of theſe 7. Churches was a great and ample citie &amp;c. yet it followeth not that they were Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oceſes (ſuch as ours are) becauſe it doth not appeare that every of thoſe Churches was divided into divers ſeveral ordinary aſſemblies &amp;c. and upon the ſame ground; the propoſition of his argument conſidered in the ſenſe before explayned, is ſtill to be rejected: to witt, becauſe to make any Churches dioceſes (ſuch as ours are) it is not enough to ſhewe, that their circuit comprehendeth a City and the Country adjoyning; he muſt alſo demonſtrate thoſe. 3. branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, which he obſerveth in the Refut: words viz. 1. that the Church is divided into diverſe ordinary aſſemblies. 2. that all of them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon ſome one as the Cheife. 3. and that they have not any of them, the power of eccleſiaſticall government a parte in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                     <p>But the Doctor not willingly directly to contradict his Refuter: <note place="margin">Sect. 7.</note> (in theſe particulars) perverteth the drifte of his words, as if he had intended to prove, that thoſe 7.

                        </gap> ſufficient, for him to deny them, till proofe be made of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Yet knowing, forſooth, that none of his Oppoſites are able to prove
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:14068:99"/> any of them; &amp; deſyring from his ſoul to ſatiſfye them in this cauſe as brethren, he wil breifly diſprove them. Who would have thought that he would have bin ſo kinde, to an adverſary ſo froward, yea convicted and reſolved (as he ſaith) not to be perſwaded? Perhaps he taketh this paines for ſome others ſake, of whome he hath better hope. Well, let us liſten to his diſcourſe; and (having firſt obſerved what he vndertaketh to diſprove) we will waie the force of his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with as indifferent an hand as we can. The firſt point where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he contradicteth his Refuter is, that he ſaith, <hi>It doth not appeare (neither is it true) that every one of thoſe. 7. Churches, was divided into diverſe ſeverall ordinary aſſemblies.</hi> The which if he will diſprove, he muſt make it appeare to be a truth, that every of thoſe Churches was divided into diverſe ordinary aſſemblies; now let us heare what he hath to ſay in this caſe. <hi>As touching the firſt</hi> (ſaith he) I have often <hi>wondred, what our brethren meane to argue from the example of thoſe Churches, which were not divided into pariſhes, to thoſe that be.</hi> But why doth he wonder, where there is no cauſe of wonder? Let him ſurceaſe his wondring <note place="margin">The won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is at the Doct. not at the Refuter.</note> till he ſhewe; both where his brethren have ſo argued; and why ſuch an argument will not hold? And 2. why giveth he all his freinds juſt cauſe, to wonder at his proceeding, that wandreth from his purpoſe; or rather juſtifyeth his Refut: in that which he vndertook to diſprove? For he doth afterwards clearely acknowledge, that which now is cloſely implied; ſc: that the ancient Churches re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meyned for a time vndivided.</p>
                     <p>3. Moreover to anſwere him in his owne words; we may wonder, what he meaneth to argue from the example of thoſe Churches which were not divided into pariſhes, to thoſe that be; and on the contrary from thoſe that in later ages were divided, to thoſe which at the firſt were not. The former may be ſene p. 5. where to prove, that the Chriſtian people of an whole province or dioceſe, though conſiſting of many particular congregations is rightly termed a Church; he alleadgeth the pattern of thoſe Apoſtolike Churches at Ieruſalem and Antioche &amp;c. which in the Apoſtles times were not diſtinguiſhed into pariſhes as himſelf acknowledgeth, pag. 69. The later appeareth by this, that his beſt reaſon, to prove that each Church had fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beginning, the circuite of the citie &amp; country adjoyned; is the practiſe of ſucceeding ages (p. 49. &amp; 55.) which after diviſion of pariſhes, combined them in one body vnder one
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:14068:99"/> Biſhop. As for his queſtions following, though I ſee not how they will ſerve his purpoſe; yet will I breefly touch vpon them, and give him leave to make his beſt advantage of the anſwere. 1. <hi>would they have,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the Church of a City &amp; country belonging to it, to be all but one congregation aſſemblinge ordinarily in one place?</hi> I anſwere; ſo long as the nomber of Chriſtians in any City and Country adjoyninge, doe not exceede the proportion of a popular congregation, I hold it beſt they continue vndivided, as the firſt Apoſtolike Churches did: but when the people of any City and Country are ſo increaſed; that their nomber will ſuffice for diverſe ſeverall aſſemblies, it were abſurde to binde them perpetually vnto an ordinary aſſembling in one place. 2. Then tell me (ſaith he) <hi>whether we that doe and of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity muſt, conſiſt of diverſe congregations, are to followe the example of any ancient Church, as it was before it was divided, or as it was after it was divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded?</hi> I affirme, that whereſoever neceſſity requireth Church-aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies to be multiplied, the practiſe of the Apoſtles, &amp; the ancient Apoſtolike Churches, is to be imitated of us, in giving to thoſe new erected aſſemblies, both the name and forme or conſtitution of Churches, and the like power for government, which thoſe apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolike Churches ſo multiplied did enjoye. Yf in this anſwere the Doctor can finde that which he deſireth, I ſhall gladly ſee what he wil hence inferre for the diſproving of his Refuters aſſertion, in any one branch thereof. 3. He addeth, They will ſay perhaps, <hi>that eche congregation after the diviſion was as that one before, nothing leſſe; let them prove that, and I will yeeld in the whole cauſe.</hi> We ſay it in deed, and will not ſhrinke from affirminge, that in the Apoſtles tymes, whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Chriſtians of any City or Country, which at firſt made one Church, were diſtributed into diverſe, there eche congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was in forme or conſtitution like to that one before, and if it be not ſo, why doth he not diſprove it? Why doth he againe put himſelf into the place of a reſpondent; giving his reader juſt occaſion to thinke, that he hath nothing of any moment to oppoſe againſt us in this pointe? As for the ages following in Conſtantines time or there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boutes, when Biſhops gained the over ſight and government of all the Churches that were multiplied in the City and Country adjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge to it, their example cannot be helde ſo fitte as the former to determine the queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of divine inſtitution; eyther for the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Church-aſſemblies; or for the juriſdiction of Biſhops and
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:14068:100"/> Presbyters, wherefore the Doctor is much deceyved, if he thinke that his teſtimonies from the decrees of councels &amp;c. (before cited as he ſaith) can convince or perſwade the conſcience of his oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites, to holde their practyſe for a divine or apoſtolicke ordinance. But to what purpoſe doth he trif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Yet in one point more, we muſt followe him, ſc. when he indeavoreth to ſhew, that the Apoſtolike Churches were Dioceſes before they were divided; for this had bin very direct to the main queſtion in hand; if he had added this clauſe, that <hi>they were Dioceſes ſuch as ours are;</hi> but he foreſawe, that this addition, would have quite marred his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket; notwithſtanding attendance ſhalbe given, to that he hath deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in defenſe of the point, which he mainteyneth.</p>

Let the D. here call to minde what he ſayd pag. 18. of his ſermon, &amp; mainteineth in the next chapter of his defence p. 65. viz. <hi>that when the Apoſtles firſt</hi> preached to the cheife Cities of any nation, they intended the converſion of the whole nation; and that when having by Gods bleſſing converted ſome, they placed preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters in any of thoſe cheife Cities; their intent and hope was by their miniſtery to converte, aſwell in the Countries adjoyning as in the City, ſo many as did belong vnto God. He addeth (in his defence) that they whoſe miniſtery was intended for the converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the City and Country (he ſhould have-ſayd <hi>of the whole nation)</hi> to their care or charge the people of that City and Country or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion belonged, both for the firſt convertinge of them, and for the government of them being converted. Whence it is alſo that he ſaith (lib. 4. pag. 131.) that it was from the beginninge intended, that the Biſhop: of the mother City ſhould be the cheif in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, notwithſtanding he conſtantly holdeth (lib. 2. pag. 114. lib. 3. pag. 21. &amp; lib. 4. pag. 7. &amp; 31.) that the Biſhops appointed by the Apoſtles over Mother Cities, were at the firſt actually but Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of their owne Dioceſes, not actually Metropolitanes, vntill diverſe Churches being conſtituted, and Biſhops ordeyned in the ſeverall Dioceſes of the province, there was a conſociation and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination of them, vnto one cheefe primate. Now if the intention of the Apoſtles in the conſtituting of Churches and presbyters or Biſhops in Mother Cities thereby intendinge the converſion of the whole nation, and the multiplying of Churches and Biſhops, as the light of the Goſpell ſhould ſpread it ſelf into the ſeverall Dioceſes: if this intention I ſay, cannot perſwade the Doctor to take the firſte

Becauſe it is better knowen what the ſubject of the leven is, before the lumpe be divided, then after: whereas in his aſſertion before expreſſed, the ſtate or conſtitution of the Church, after pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes were multiplyed in city and country, and ſubordinated to the juriſdiction of one conſiſtorie, is brought (as better knowne) to ſhewe howe fatte the circuite of the Church and ſpirituall juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction ſtretched, when as yet but an handfull of people (in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of the reſt) was ſeaſoned by the Miniſtery of the goſpell. Perhaps his meaning is that as he which putteth a little leven into an whole bache of breade, intendeth that the leven ſhould in time, ſpreade her vertue over all, and ſo the whole maſſe of meale made one body of a well levened lump: ſo alſo the Apoſtles and firſte founders of Churches, when they firſt planted a Church, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Presbyters in any citie or Dioceſe, did intend, that the leven of their doctrine, being conveyed into the hartes of the whole multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, all might be made one body of a Dioceſan Church. If this be ſo; ſeing in this compariſon the Church is as the leven, or that part of meale which is firſt leavened, we may by his owne compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon diſcover the abſurdity of his former aſſertion. For as the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuite of the leven (or meale leavened) is at the firſt putting in, (and for a while after) farre leſſe, then when all is leavened: ſo alſo the circuite of the Church, at the firſt erecting of it in any city (&amp; for ſome ages after) was farre leſſe then when the whole people of the Dioceſe imbraced the faith.

<pb n="192" facs="tcp:14068:103"/> his ſecond thoughtes, if he can make any more advantage of it hereafter; I now demaund how he knoweth that the intention of the Apoſtles was ſuch as he immagineth, viz. that all the people of City and Country after the converſion of the whole ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue parts of the Church, which at the firſt conſiſted but of a few.</p>
                     <p>Maſter D. ſuppoſing (as it ſeemeth) it were but reaſon to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere <note place="margin">Sect. 10. ad ſect. 6. p. 49</note> therevnto, doth aforehand prevente it, and will have us to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that he knoweth it. And therefore goeth on and ſaith. <hi>If you aske me how I knowe this? I anſwere. Firſt, becauſe the whole Church of God ever ſince the Apoſtles daies vnto our age, hath ſo vnderſtood the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the Apoſtles, and of their firſt founders; the circuite of every Church, having from the beginning, included not onely the City but the Country thereto belonging.</hi> I muſt here demaund againe; how came it that the Church of God, did vnderſtand the Apoſtles intention to be ſuch? And how commeth the D. to knowe that they had any ſuch vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandinge? 1. Did the Church of God receive their vnderſtanding in this point from the mouthes or pennes of the Apoſtles? If they diſcovered their intention by writinge; be the Doctor intreated, we pray him, to ſhewe us where we may reade it for our learninge? If not by writinge, but by tradition? It is ſtrange a matter of ſuch conſequence, for the well-orderinge of all Churches to the worlds ende, ſhould be committed to ſuch an happ-hazzard. 2. And how hath the Church informed the Doctor of their vnderſtandinge? hath he received it alſo by tradition, or from the writinges of the <note place="margin">The D. firſt reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed by himſelf.</note> 
                        <hi>Lords worthies</hi> in all ages? Why doth he not either quote us their bookes wherein they affirme it; or give us the catalogue of ſuch as have from hand to hand conveied it to him? Till he hath given ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfaction in theſe particulars, let him not thinke but his reader will deeme his firſt reaſon to be a ſpeach voyde of reaſon, yea a mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrous vntruth confuted by himſelf, as ſhall well appeare in the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his reaſons followinge.</p>
                     <p>His ſecond reaſon he laieth downe thus; ſaying. <hi>Secondly becauſe that diviſion of Churches which was 300. or 400. yeares after Chriſte, with their limits and circuites, was ordinarily the ſame which had bene from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, as before hath bene testified by divers auncient Councels.</hi> Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily and from the beginning? So he ſaith in deed. But 1. doth any Councell that he hath alleadged, (pag. 22. &amp; 37. or elſwhere) teſtify the circuites of the Churches, to have bene from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb facs="tcp:14068:103"/> of their planting by the Apoſtles, the ſame, that they were in their owne times? Is not all the queſtion (in thoſe Councells) of Country pariſhes, or ſuch partes of any Country as neither deſyred to have a Biſhop, or were challenged of diverſe Biſhops? The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning therefore (whereof they ſpeake) muſt be taken for the time of erecting Churches in Country villages, and ſubordinating them to the Biſhop of the City adjoyninge. Neyther yet doe they aſcribe this to any ordinance, or intention of the Apoſtles, or firſt founders of the Church, in the Citie; but to ancient cuſtome, (as the words of the Epheſin Councell ſhew, which he hath ſet downe. Can. 2. pag. 37.) ratified by eccleſiaſticall lawes, and Canons (falſly called Canons) of the Apoſtles. 2. But why ſaith he, the circuites were ordinarily the ſame? Meaneth he, it was no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon uſe to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them? Or that it was againſt order and vnlawfull? It cannot be the later, ſince he confeſſeth (pag. 23.) that if there were cauſe, (ſc. for the greatnes of the Charge and nomber of people &amp;c.) the circuites of Dioceſes were leſſened, &amp; newe Biſhoprickes erected. Beholde then, howe worthily the D. reaſoneth. The diviſion of Churches with their circuites, remayned till 400. yeares after Chriſte, the ſame which it had bene from the beginning of erecting Churches in the remote parts of any Dioceſe, and ſubordinatinge them to the Biſhops of the Cities adjoyninge, vnleſſe the greatnes of the charge required the circuite to be leſſened &amp; a new Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick to be eſtabliſhed. Ergo, it was the intention of the Apoſtles, that the Churches which they planted, ſhould have the ſame Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite before the diviſion of pariſhes, that they had after. May not the contrary, with much more probability, be thus argued? When the charge of an whole dioceſe after the diſtribution of pariſhes grewe over greate for one Biſhop, &amp; the nomber of people in ſome partes, deſyred to have a newe Biſhop: the Circuites of Churches or Dioceſes were altered. Ergo it was never intended by the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles (or at leaſt the Fathers of thoſe times were ignorant of any ſuch intention) that the Circuite of every Church ſhould alwayes conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue the ſame, aſwell when all in City and Country were converted, as when there were but a fewe.

And yet (alas for pity) they (whome he meaneth) cannot yeeld him any comfort. For what ſay they? Forſooth, that in the diſtribution of dioceſes, provinces and patriarchall preheminences, the ſtate eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall followed the civill. And when did the Church take up this Courſe? Doe they ſay that the Apoſtles began it, or intended any ſuch matter? No, it was thought a convenient courſe by the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops after the Apoſtles daies, for the better managing of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſes in their Synods, and Meetings, that as for civill juſtice; ſo alſo for eccleſiaſticall affaires, recourſe ſhould be had to the Cityes and Shire-townes. Neyther was this order vniverſall or perpetuall, as the Doctor himſelf acknowledgeth in Pergamus and Thyatira. pag. 63. yea he affirmeth that by ancient cuſtome, the whole nation of Scythians, having many Cities, townes, and Caſtles, made but one Dioceſe: and that the Churches throughout a large Province, were but part of one Paraecia or dioceſe, as may be ſene pag. 10. &amp; 40. of this his defenſe. Wherefore this reaſon of his, doth alſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fure (and not confirme) his fantaſticall conceite of the Apoſtles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. And it argueth he ſpake directly againſt the light of his conſcience, when he ſayd; <hi>that the whole Church of God, ever ſince the Apoſtles daies vnto our age, hath ſo vnderſtood</hi> (as he doth) <hi>the intention of the Apoſtles, and the firſt founders of the apoſtolike Churches.</hi> Wherefore ſince he hath no better ground for his bolde affirmation, <hi>(that the circuite of each Church in the intention of the Apoſtles or firſt founders was the ſame before the diviſion of pariſhes that it was after)</hi> we may well take his concluſion which he inferreth thereupon, to be layd in the ſand of his owne vaine immagination, viz. <hi>that though thoſe Churches had not bin divided into ſeverall congregations, yet had they each of them bene dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But now (to returne to the point, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which he hath longe wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <note place="margin">Sect. 11. ad ſect. 6. page 50.</note> at his pleaſure, to little purpoſe) he addeth, <hi>that at the time of writing the Revelation, it is more then probable, that they conteyned diverſe congregations.</hi> If it be more then probable, then, I hope, his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes whereon he buildeth are more then probabilities, even

But if there be not ſo much as a ſhadowe of probabilitie, in any thinge he hath alleadged; no man can juſtly blame his Refuter, if he ſay; It is more then proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Doctor is deceived; and ſeeketh to deceive, with his vaine braggs of proving, what he avoucheth. Let vs therefore examine his beſt probabilities. The firſt is, <hi>That<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when Paul had continued but two yeares at Epheſus, the holy Ghost teſtifieth (Act. 19. 10.) that all which inhabited Aſia (ſo properly called) did heare the word of the Lord.

                     <p>In all this if there be any probability, it lieth in his laſt wordes, wherein he ſeemeth thus to argue. <hi>S. Paul maketh mention of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Aſia. Ergo, you may not think there was but that Church at Epheſus in his time.</hi> The conſequent of this Enthymem is ſubtilly ſet down. If his meaning be to perſwade his reader, that there was more <note place="margin">The D. lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth downe his conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence ſubtilly.</note> then one Church at Epheſus in Pauls time, becauſe he mentioneth Churches in Aſia, his conſequence is worſe then nought: nothing hindreth his Refuter to think, that there was one onely Church at Epheſus, although there were more Churches in Aſia. That epiſtle to the Corinthians wherein he mentioneh the Churches of Aſia. was written before his departure from Epheſus (recorded Acts. 20. 1.) as we maye gather, 1. Cor. 16. 5. 8. 10. compared with Acts. 19. 21. 22. yet, when after this, he had ſpeach with the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Epheſus (thoſe many Elders which he now telleth us, Paul had there placed) they had no ſeverall titles or cures, but in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon attended the whole flocke or Church, as himſelf avoucheth (ſerm. pag. 18.) from the very words of Paul, Acts. 20. 28. where he doth apparantly contradict himſelf, if he now labour to perſwade, that there were at that time more Churches (or diſtinct congregations) <note place="margin">A contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in the D. if he &amp;c.</note> then one that Epheſus.

Laſtly, if any man think, that after the preaching of ſuch and ſo many, (as he ſaith) for the ſpace of 45. yeares, it is probable there were more then 7. ordinarie congregations, let him judge indifferently betwixt the Doctor and his Refuter whether it be not more likely his Refuters aſſertion is true, <hi>that there were no more then 7. diſtinct Churches,</hi> (ſuch as Coloſſae, Magneſia, and Trallis, whereof he ſpeaketh) then that <hi>each of the</hi> 7.

Churches conteyned both the citie and countrie adjoyning.</hi> Firſt therefore I demaund what he meaneth by citie and countrie? whether thoſe parts of the ancient dioceſe, which he calleth <hi>paroikian kai choran</hi> (ſerm. pag. 25. and def. pag. 13. and 36.) that is the citie with the ſuburbs and the whole countrie ſubject to the citie? If ſo, then this whole circuite, (in his vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding) was the circuite of every of thoſe 7. Churches. But then, I demaund againe, did thoſe Churches containe in their circuite, only the walles, dwelling houſes and feildes, and not alſo the people inhabiting within that circuite? if he ſhould either exclude all the people or include all, (the ſtate of thoſe times being ſuch; that the generall multitude in all cities and countrey were Pagans, as he confeſſeth pag. 54.) he ſhould contradict both himſelfe &amp; the truth which he delivereth, p. 3. &amp; 5. where he ſaith, that <hi>eccleſia in all places of the new Teſtament (excepting Act. 19.) is appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to the companie of the faithfull, and ſignifieth a companie of men cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out of the world vnto ſalvation by Chriſt, that is to ſay, a companie of Chriſtians.</hi> Wherefore, as I will not doe him that wrong, to think he meaneth by citie and countrey, the houſes and feildes onely: ſo if queſtion be made, what people he incloſeth, within the circuite of thoſe Churches (or of the cities and countries, which, he ſaith, they contayned) vnleſſe he will depart from the truth, and that with contradiction to himſelf, he muſt acknowledge that he meaneth
<pb facs="tcp:14068:111"/> none other, then the Chriſtian people of thoſe cities &amp; the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries adjoyning. And yet, if he limit every Church to ſo narrow a compaſſe, for the people which it conteined; who will beleeve him, (or how will he perſwade and prove) that the whole citie meaning <hi>Vrbs</hi> (to uſe his owne wordes) and the whole countrie belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the citie, was conteyned within the circuite of the Church? for ſince the Church of any citie or place, is nothinge elſe, but the company of Chriſtians there. If it be abſurde to ſay, that a ſmall companie of Chriſtians (not an handfull to a great heape in compariſon of the heathen, that filled citie &amp; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie) did containe in their circuite, an whole citie, with the whole countrie adjoyning: then is it no leſſe abſurd to affirme the ſame, of any Church, which is intituled the Church of this or that citie, yea, take all the people of any citie or countrie; who is ſo ſimple, but he knoweth that the citie and countrie containeth them, and not they the citie? Wherefore, though, all the people had bene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to Chriſtianity: yet had it bene a groſſe error both in logick and philoſiphie to ſay, <hi>that the Church did contayne the citie and the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie.</hi> To leave then, the naturall and proper ſignification of citie &amp; countrie: and to carrie the words by an uſuall metonymie vnto the people (q. d. they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teined citie &amp; countrie, that is, the people of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie &amp; countrie) I deſire to be informed from his owne mouth, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he meane thoſe people onely, that had already receyved the fayth, or thoſe alſo, that were in time to be converted? The former doth beſte agree with that foundation, layd by him in this defence (chap. 2. ſect. 2. and 3.) where he reſtreyneth (as before is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) both the name and nature of a Church vnto a company of Chriſtian people, but ſo ſmall a companie as at that time imbraced Chriſtianity, will fall farr ſhort of his purpoſe; not onely of conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Churches to be properly dioceſes; but alſo, of incloſing, within that whol flock or Church, over which the Presbyters were made Byſhops, (Act. 20. 28.) the whole number of ſuch as belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to God, in citie and countrie; even thoſe that ſhould afterwards imbrace the faith, aſ well as thoſe that made preſent profeſſion ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, for ſo he vnderſtandeth that ſcripture (ſerm. pag. 18. def. pag. 66.) and therefore inferreth (ſerm. pag. 19.) that the Preſbyteries in the Apoſtles times were appointed to whole cities and countries annexed, that they might both convert them, &amp; feed them being converted: (as a litle after he ſaith, <hi>were provided, not onely for the cities
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:14068:112"/> themſelves, but alſo for the Countries adjoyninge, which were converted or to be converted.</hi> Which words doe clearely ſhewe, that by the Cities &amp; Countries (which at firſt, he ſaid, were the Churches; now he ſaith were conteined in the circuite of the Churches) he meaneth all the <note place="margin">11.

But in this conſtruction of his words (beſides an apparant contradiction with himſelf, in a maine principle of Chriſtian doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, which reſtraineth the name of a Church to a companie of Chriſtian people:) he falleth into a childiſh error (farre vnbeſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming a Doctor in divinitie) in breaking downe that partition wall, which all ſound divines have ſet, betwene the viſible Churches of Chriſte; and the inviſible company of the electe, not yet brought home vnto the faith. For howſoever ſuch as God appointed vnto life, and intendeth in time to call, are in his account members of his <note place="margin">The D. aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption ſenſles &amp; abſurd: &amp; his defenſe of it much more.</note> inviſible Church; yet it is againſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſenſe, as well as the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of true divinitie; to reckon them for parts of the viſible Church, which as yet have had no manner of entrance into Chriſtianity. In this ſenſe therefore (which his ſermon and the defence thereof aymeth at) I reject his aſſumption as an abſurd and ſenſles poſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
                     <p>And the defenſe which he tendreth, is much more abſurd, when <note place="margin">Sect. 17.</note> he ſaith, <hi>that the circuite of the Church was the ſame, when there were few &amp; when there were many, yea when all were Chriſtians.</hi> For vntill countrie townes were converted, and ſubjected to the over ſight of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of the City adjoyninge; how could they and their people, be reputed parts of the Citie-Church, or incloſed within her circuite? Wherefore ſince it is confeſſed (ſerm. pag. 24.) that Country townes remeined heatheniſh for a time, after the converſion of the Citie; it muſt be confeſſed alſo, that the Churches circuite at the firſt, did not incloſe the Countrie villagies, as it did afterwardes. Notwithſtanding, to juſtify his former aſſertion; he alleadgeth, <hi>that there were no more Biſhops ſet over the City and Country, when all were Chriſtians, then when there were but a fewe; the ſame Biſhop of the City ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving juriſdiction, over all the Chriſtians both in the City and the Country, aſwell when all were Chriſtians, as when but a fewe.</hi> He would have ſaid, that the Biſhops which ſucceeded ſome ages after in the ſame City, had the ſame juriſdiction over all the people of City and Country, when they were all converted to the faith; which the firſt apoſtolike Biſhops, had over thoſe fewe in the City &amp; Country adjoyning, that
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:14068:112"/> firſt yeelded obedience to the Goſpell. For he acknowledgeth (Def. pag. 54.) that it could ſcarce be verified, in any place till Conſtantines time (which was above 200. yeares after the Apoſtle Iohns daies) that all the people of City &amp; Country were Chriſtians. But with what bands can the D. tie togither theſe parts of his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning? <note place="margin">with what hands can the Doct. tie togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the parts of his reaſoning?</note> The Biſhops in Conſtantines time and after, had the like juriſdiction, over all the people of City and Country, that the firſt Apoſtolike Biſhops, had over thoſe fewe that firſt imbraced Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity. Therefore, the circuite of the Church was at the firſt, when they were but fewe, the ſame that it was after, when all became Chriſtians. Is there not much more probability in this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequence? The Biſhops in Conſtantines daies and after, had the like juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over all the people of City and Country, that the firſt apoſtolike Biſhops had over thoſe fewe, which at firſt imbraced Chriſtianity. Ergo, the circuite of the Church and Biſhops charge, was farr leſſe, whiles there were but a fewe; then it was when all the people of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Country were converted vnto the Chriſtian faith. Which of theſe two hath more probability I leave to the indifferent reader to judge. Wherefore till the D. can make good the conſequence of his reaſoninge; all the proofes which he braggeth of for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of his antecedent (the ancienteſt of them being after the firſt 300. yeares, as appeareth (Def. pag. 36. &amp;c.) doe give juſt occaſion of returning into his owne booſome that definitive ſentence, which he delivereth againſt his oppoſites, viz. that the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall conſent and perpetuall practiſe of all Chriſtendome ſince the Apoſtles times, ought without co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon to prevayle with all men (in perſwading the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to acknowledge, that every Churches circuite, was much inlarged, by the generall converſion of all, in Cities and Countrey townes:) above the authority of a fewe, ſelf-conceited perſons (ſuch as the D. and his aſſociates) not ſo ſingular for lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge, as they are ſingular in opinion: when they would make the world beleeve if they could, that every Churches circuite, was the ſame at firſt, when but a fewe imbraced the faith, that it was after, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all the people of City &amp; Country, were made members of one dioceſan Church.

The truth is, each of theſe Churches was conteined within thoſe cities, as a ſmall heape of corne is conteined in a great and large barne. 2. And why doth he here alſo depart from the words of his ſermon; which were that <hi>ſome of thoſe 7.

And had his Refuter thus analyſed his words; it is likely the D. would have bin more offended, then he is with that forme which he uſed, in putting all his ſpeach into one connexive argument. 3.

<pb n="216" facs="tcp:14068:115"/> are the partes of a Dioceſe; and his meaning muſt be the ſame in the two laſt Churches, Philadelphia and Thyatira. Wherefore <note place="margin">well hunge together</note> his argument hangeth togither in this faſhion. Of the 7. Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; 5. conteyned Mother cities &amp; the Provinces ſubject to them: the other two conteyned Dioceſan cities &amp; the countries to them belonging. Ergo every of thoſe Churches were of a like circuite and conſtitution, in conteyning a Dioceſan country togither with the citie. But if that be true which he ſaith, of <hi>Philadelphia</hi> and <hi>Thyatira,</hi> that the one was ſubject to <hi>Sardis,</hi> th'other to <hi>Pergamus:</hi> then were the Churches of <hi>Philadelphia &amp; Thyatira</hi> conteyned within the circuite of Sardis and Pergamus, as partes of the Country &amp; Province ſubject to thoſe cities. And hence it will followe that theſe 7. Churches, were not of one forme and conſtitution; but of differing condition; ſome being onely Dioceſan, the reſt metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan or provinciall Churches. So that, like as his firſt ſpeach ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally delivered of all 7. (that they were great and ample Cities) is now limited to thoſe 5. mother Cities: (pag. 45.) ſo in his next defence, he may doe well to reſtreine vnto the ſame 5. Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Churches, that which now he affirmeth of all 7. viz. that they comprized within their circuite, all the Churches that were in Aſia, whether in the Cities or in the Countries therevnto belonginge. But ſince the ſpirit of God, giveth equall honor to every of thoſe Churches, &amp; no prerogative to any one above another, his proofes had need to be very pregnant &amp; demonſtrative, that ſhall perſwade the contrary. And this may ſuffice, to ſhew how little cauſe he hath, to bragg (as he doth p. 52.) that he hath made good his aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">The D. braggeth without cauſe.</note> by neceſſary proofe: for in both his proofes (firſt joyntly and then ſeverally) his antecedent is falſe, and his conſequence ſophiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall.</p>

Yet to make the weaknes of his collection the more apparant, let him weigh the worth of theſe conſequences followinge. <hi>It was Chriſts</hi> intent, in ſpeaking as he doth to Peter, Math. 16. 17. 18. 19. Luc. 22. 31. 32. Iohn. 13. 8. 10. &amp; 21. 15, that the reſt of his fellow-Apoſtles, ſhould take notice of all that he ſpake

                        </gap> inſtruction and conſolation. Ergo the reſt were in ſubjectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to Peter. Againe, <hi>the Angel informeth</hi> Marie Magdale and the other Marie of Chriſtes reſurrection, and gave them charge to tell his diſciples that he was riſen, Math. 28. 1. 5. 7. Ergo the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were ſubject to the juriſdiction of thoſe weomen. <hi>Paul in writing to the Church</hi> of God at Corinth, writeth alſo to all the Saints that were in all Achaia, yea to all that every where did call on the name of the Lord 1 Cor. 1. 2. and 2 Cor. 1. 1. And what he wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to the Church at Coloſſe, he willeth them to cauſe it to be read in the Church of the Laodiceans. Col. 4. 16. Ergo, the Church of Laodicea was in ſubjection to the Church of Coloſſe. And to the Church of Corinth, was not onely all Achaia, but all other Churches in the world ſubject, to her juriſdiction. But, who ſeeth not what abſurd concluſions may be multiplyed, if a man ſhould proceed in this veine of reaſoning? 5. As for that <hi>Epiphonema,</hi> which concludeth each epiſtle directed ſeverally to the Angell of each Church. <hi>(Let him that hath an eare, heare what the Spirit ſaith to the Churches)</hi> if he had not firſt conceived that it would be ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to his cauſe, to perſwade his reader that thoſe 7. Churches did (every one of them) conteine many ſeverall congregations within their circuite; he would never have dreamed of any ſuch conſtruction of thoſe words, as he now co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendeth to us, viz. <hi>that what Chriſt writeth to the Angel, he writeth to the Churches that were vnder his charge.</hi> For as he hath no ground for it; either from the coherence of his text, or from any interpreter old, or newe; ſo it ſeemeth to have vnadviſedly ſlipped from him; ſeing as it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed by himſelfe; ſo it overthroweth one maine part of his building. Confuted it is by that himſelfe ſetteth downe, in the ende of his table (pag. 5.) of the ſignification of the word <hi>eccleſia;</hi> where he taketh the word <hi>Churches,</hi> in the concluſion of each epiſtle, indefinitely <hi>for any company of Chriſtians,</hi> not defining eyther the place or ſocietie; whether of a nation, or citie &amp;c. whereas now he taketh it difinitely for the congregations, which were parts or members of that citie-Church, which is mentioned in the <note place="margin">14. a Double contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction? in the D.</note> beginning of each epiſtle. And if there be a truth in his conſtruction of thoſe words, (viz. <hi>that what Chriſt writeth to every Angel, he writeth alſo to the Churches that be vnder his charge;)</hi> then
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:14068:117"/> thoſe Churches were intereſſed with the Angell, in all that which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended or reproved in him. And hence it will followe, that if a correcting power over Miniſters may be rightly gathered (as he conceiveth ſerm. pag. 49. Def. lib. 3. pag. 135.) from the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation or reproofe, given Apoc. 2. verſ. 2. &amp; 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-churches diſtinguiſhed, either in City or Country adjoyning, were partners with the Mother-Church and the Angel or Biſhop thereof, in that corrective power over Miniſters; which he labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth (in the places before alleadged) to eſtabliſhe in the hands of one Biſhop or Angel onely.</p>
                     <p>Thus we ſee how he fareth in the defence of his propoſition. In <note place="margin">Sect. 21. ad ſect. 10. D. pag. 57. 62.</note> the aſſumption the Refuter obſerved two vntruthes, in aſmuch as it cannot be proved, either that all other Churches in Aſia, were written vnto, as within the circuite and juriſdiction of thoſe 7; or that any of the 7. was a Mother-City. To make the vntruthes of the former apparant, he reaſoneth diſiunctiuely from the diverſe acceptions of Aſia, diſtinguiſhed by hiſtorians into Aſia Major<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Aſia minor, and Aſia more properly ſo called. Concerninge the firſt; becauſe it is vnlikely, (or rather impoſſible) that our Saviour writing to that third parte of the World (which was not much leſſe then both the other) ſhould ſubſcribe and ſend his epiſtles onely to thoſe 7. that are in one little corner of it; the Refuter profeſſeth, he will not once let it come into his thought to imagine that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Doct. would have us beleeve, that all the Churches in Aſia Major (which conteined the great Kingdome of China, with the Eaſt-Indies, Perſia, Tartaria and a great part of Turky) ſhould be pariſhes, belonginge to ſome one or more of theſe 7. Churches. Secondly to reſtreine it to Aſia minor; becauſe the Scripture recordeth many Churches to be in it, (as Derbe, Lyſtra, Iconium, Antioch in Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidia, Perga in Pamphilia, and diverſe Churches in Galatia;) he ſuppoſeth that none is ſo much bewitched with the love of Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan Churches, as to imagine, that all thoſe famous Churches were but dependantes on theſe 7. Thirdly therefore, to come as lowe as may be, and to vnderſtand by Aſia, that which is properly ſo called, and otherwiſe Sarrum; even there alſo or neere, we finde di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe other Churches, as thoſe of Coloſſe, Hierapolis &amp; Troas me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Scriptures, (to let paſſe Magneſia and Trallis recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in other writers) which did not belonge to any of theſe 7. and therefore he taketh it to be cleare, that our Saviour intended not to
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:14068:117"/> write to all the Churches of Aſia; but onely to thoſe 7. that are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Loe here the ſum, &amp; almoſt the words, of the Ref. anſwer touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt parte of the D. aſſumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: now let us ſee the parts of his reply.

Thirdly to teach him (if he doe not knowe) that none of thoſe countries were conteined in that Aſia whereof the Ho. Ghoſt ſpeaketh; he ſaith that by comparing. Act. 2. 9. 10. &amp; 6. 9. &amp; 16. 6. 7. and 1 Pet. 1. 1; he may find that manie parts of Aſia minor, are reckoned as diverſe countries, from that Aſia, which is mentioned in the ſcripture. Fourthly he addeth, that if the Ref. would needs have ſhewen his skill in Geography, he ſhould have done well, to have ſet downe the bounds and limitts of this Aſia, whereof we ſpake. And becauſe the Ref. ſhould not prevent him, that he might have all the praiſe for ſkill herein, he vndertaketh to doe it. Fiftly, he <hi>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth</hi> at length to refute, that which his Ref. ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning thoſe Ch: which he mentioned to be either in Aſia, properly ſo called, or nere there abouts.

                        </note> and of <hi>cavilling againſt the light of his conſcience:</hi> ſeing it is cleare, the Ref. mentioneth the two firſt acceptions of the word <hi>Aſia</hi> (not as though he were ignorant how it is to be taken; nor yet to perſwade his reader, that the D. doth ſo largely ſtreach it; for he profeſſeth the contrarie, as before appeareth) but onely to fortify his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whiles he ſheweth that which way ſoever the word be taken; it cannot be, that all the Churches of Aſia, ſhould be reputed as parts of thoſe 7. or ſubjected vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Next, touching the bounds of Aſia properly ſo called, becauſe it is a point of skill and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eaſily be determined, the D. to ſhew his varietie of reading, indeavoureth to reconcile the ſcripture and thoſe that write of Geography, who varie from him (as he confeſſeth) in this point.
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:14068:118"/> According to the ſcriptures, in his account, Aſia includeth Ionia, Myſia, Pergamene, Lydia, or Maeonia, and perhaps Caria. The ancient Geographers include within the limits thereof all Phry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia, both the greater and the leſſer, wherein Troy ſtood; and all Myſia, even the greater called Olympina, and the leſſe called Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamene: which excludeth from that Aſia, whereof Iohn ſpeaketh: becauſe Phrygia, and Myſia, Olympina, are reckoned apart from Aſia Act. 16. 6. 7. For we are not to merveil (he ſayth pag. 60.) that a leſſe circuite is aſſigned to it in the ſcripture, ſeing within a leſſe compaſſe then that which the ſcripture aſſigneth therevnto, it is circumſcribed by others; which ſeclude from Aſia, both Lydia and Caria as he ſheweth out of the ſubſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in the Nicen councel, &amp; from the ſpeach of Eunapius, in Maximo.

To this teſtimony, I referre the Doct. becauſe I hope, he will reverence his gray-haires and great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, though he lightly eſteeme the Refuter for his ſmall skill in Geography. And withall I pray the reader to take notice of this, that the Doctor preſumeth all men will take his word for the limitts which he giveth to that Aſia, whereof S. Iohn ſpeaketh; for he diſagreeth with both thoſe accounts, which himſelfe men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth, in giving to <hi>Aſia</hi> a leſſe circuite, then the former, which include both <hi>Phrygia</hi> &amp; <hi>Myſia</hi> major in it; and a larger then the later, which ſeclude both <hi>Caria,</hi> and <hi>Lydia</hi> from it. And though he ſeeme to grounde his opinion on the teſtimony of S. Luke in his ſtory of the Actes of the Apoſtles; yet in truth, he departeth alſo from him, and ſo ſtandeth ſingular in his conceit, without any to ſupport or ſecond him therein. For as he hath rightly, obſerved, Phrygia and Myſia to be diſtinguiſhed from Aſia by S. Luke, Acts 16. 6. 7. ſo he might by a better ſearch have found, that <hi>Caria</hi> alſo is (in his account) divided from Aſia. For it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded by Luke, <hi>(Act.</hi> 20. 15. 16.) that Paul having determined not to ſpend any time in Aſia, ſayled by Epheſus, and therefore from Trogillium, he came to Miletum, and from thence ſent for the Elders of Epheſus to come to him; which ſheweth that Miletu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it may well be ſuppoſed, that the Angel of the Church at Epheſus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to whom the firſt epiſtle was directed, was Oneſimus.</hi> Yea he build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſo confidently on this ſuppoſall, that without any ſtagger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he ſayth <hi>he is able to ſhewe that Oneſimus was at that time Biſhop of Epheſus, as the very man whom the Holy Ghoſt calleth the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of that Church (Defenc. lib. 1, pag. 34. and lib. 4. pag.</hi> 40.) With a little change the Doctors premiſſes will ſerve to juſtify the Ref: againſt himſelfe in this manner. When Ignatius wrote his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles, the Churches of Trallis and Magneſia flouriſhed and enjoyed their Biſhops Presbyters and Deacons; neyther were any thing inferiour in eſtimation and honour unto other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; as appeareth by his Epiſtles written to them, and placed before others. Nowe he wrote whiles Clemens was Biſhop of Rome, that is, betwixt the yeare of our Lord 90. and 99. And S. Iohn wrote his Revelation in the yeare 97. Therefore it may well be ſuppoſed (yea it is ſo evidently proved, that the Doct<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cannot contradict it) that the Churches of Magneſia and Tral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis were flouriſhing Churches, when S.

(See Bucholcer Ind: Chrono. log. &amp; Euſeb: in Chron.) yet Nicephorus (lib. 3. cap. 2. refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it to the 3. yeare of Trajane, which was at the utmoſt but 6. yeares after Iohns writing the Revelation. Wherefore ſince it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by Ignatius his epiſtles to the Churches of Magneſia and Trallis, that they were at that time (not newly converted, as the Doctor intimateth, but) perfectly eſtabliſhed and furniſhed, aſwel with Biſhops as with other officers, (as is before noted) Let the reader judg whether it be not more likely, that thoſe Churches had a beginning, at leaſt of their ſtanding at that time: then that they were not converted to the faith, as the D. would perſwade; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſeing they were within the Province of Epheſus (as he affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) which had ſo many helps to ſpread the faith of Chriſt though<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the corners thereof, that he thinketh it abſurd (as we ſawe before in anſw. to his 6. ſection &amp; pag. 61.) that any man ſhould make any ſcruple to yeeld, that many particular co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregations were ſettled before that time, within the Dioceſan circuite, of that Ch: of Epheſus.

In the civill diſtribution of provinces, and adminiſtrations for government, Philadelphia was ſubject to Sardis &amp; Thyatira to Pergamus, as he noteth pag. 63. out of Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, lib. 6. cap. 29. and 30. but in eccleſiaſticall government the Churches of Philadelphia, and Thyatira, were nothing inferiour to Sardis &amp; Pergamus: for they were all honoured with the name of candleſticks, and Churches, in the middeſt whereof Chriſt walked.

But this is ſo groſſe an vntruth; that the D. cannot but ſee it, and unleſſe there be an other vaile to ſhadowe him wil be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to avouch it; much more to alleadge the words of the Holy Ghoſt (Apoc. 1. 16. &amp; 2. 1.) to mainteyne it; ſeing he acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all the Miniſters of the goſpel to the worlds end, to be, by their office, <hi>ſtarres</hi> and ſhining lights (ſo his ſermon of the dignitie of the Miniſters, p. 61.) And in this ſermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in queſt. p. 55. he ſaith of Dioc:

Wherefore there being no need of any longer diſcourſe, to remove the vaile of this firſt argument, I might here proceed to the ſecond. But before I come to it, (to prove the contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to his concluſion, I thus reaſon;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>All the Miniſters of the word that had charge to feed and overſee the Chriſtian people, in thoſe 7. Churches, were ſignified by the ſtarres which Chriſt held in his right hand.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>But all the Miniſters of the word, that had charge to feede; and overſee the Chriſtian people, in thoſe 7. Churches; were more then 7. ſingular perſons onely. Therefore the perſons ſignified by the starres, which Chriſt held in his right hand, were more then 7. ſingular perſons onely.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The aſſumption needeth no proofe, (more then what is after gathered from Act. 20. 28.) ſince it is of all our adverſaries ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, and the deniall of it is the utter overthrowe of their whole building. For how ſhould this text juſtify the ſuperio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of Biſhops above other Miniſters; if there were not diverſe Miniſters in each of theſe Churches, ſubject to one Biſhop? And if there were but onely 7. angels, (that is Biſhops) in theſe 7. chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, there was then but one onely angel or Biſhop in each ſeverall Church; but it is cleare by that place of the Acts, that there was more then one in that Church of Epheſus, ſeing it ſpeaketh of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops in the plurall number ordeined, and ſet over that Church by the Holy Ghoſt; and it muſt needs be with the reſt of theſe 7. as it was with it, and others, Phil. 1. 1. Act. 13. 1. 2. &amp; 14. 23. Tit. 1. 5.</p>
                     <p>The Propoſition is a truth not to be denied, ſeing it is alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed by the Doctor (ſerm: of the dignitie of the Miniſters, pag. 46. and 61.) and eaſy to be proved, if any man elſe ſhould gain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> ſay it. For 1. the true reaſon, why the name of <hi>Starres</hi> is vſed to ſignify the Miniſters of God, and to explane their function is this, viz. that as the ſtarres are ſet in the firmament to ſhine upon the earth (Gen. 1. 17.) and to governe the night: (Pſal. 136. 9.) ſo it is the office of the Miniſters in generall (&amp; not of Dioceſan Biſhops in particular) to ſhine as lights vnto the Churches in all puritie of doctrine and holynes of converſation (Mat. 5. 14. 15. Ioh. 5. 35. Phil. 2. 15. cum cap. 1. 1.) that men which naturally are in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:14068:126"/> (2. Cor. 4. 6. Eph. 5. 8.) may have their hartes enlightened &amp; converted, Act. 26. 18. Dan. 12. 3.) and ſtill directed in the way of obedience. Pſal. 119. 105.) Wherefore ſince it is the office and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, of all Miniſters in generall, thus to ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ine and enlighten others; it muſt needes be granted, that the name of ſtarres doth equally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to all. 2. And in this ſenſe the word is vſed, when it is ſayd, that the third part of the ſtarres was darkned (Rev. 8. 12.) &amp; that the Dragons taile drew, the third part of the ſtarres of heaven, and caſt them to the earth, (Rev. 12. 4.) For hereby we are to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the corruption and apoſtacie (not of Biſhops &amp; Archbiſhops one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but) of preachers &amp; Teachers in generall; which in huge heaps and multitudes, were drawne to imbrace &amp; teache, haereſy, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, and idolattie. 3. Moreover, although it be ſo with the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the word, as it is with the <hi>starres,</hi> that (as one ſtarre dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth from an other in glory. 1. Cor. 15. 41. ſome here excelling others in guifts and labours, (1. Cor. 12. 4. 11. &amp; 2. Cor. 11. 23) ſhall alſo exceed them hereafter in glorie: (1. Cor. 3. 8.) yet it no where appeareth in holy ſcripture, that the name of <hi>ſtarres</hi> is given to any one degree, or order of Miniſters; much leſſe appropriated to the epiſcopall function, to declare their preheminence, digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or advancement above other preachers. 4. Neyther is that gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious protection and ſafetie which is aſſured to the Miniſters of Chriſt (by his holding the 7. ſtarres in his right hand. (Rev. 1. 16. 20. &amp; 2. 1.) any priviledge proper to Biſhops, but a favour which he communicateth to all, that faithfully ſerve him, in their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriall function whatever it be, for the promiſe both of Chriſts pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and aſſiſtance (Exod. 3. 12.

And that many angels or Biſhops in Epheſus, cannot prove that there were in Epheſus many particular congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations. For ſince the holy Ghoſt calleth the Chriſtians at Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, one Church and one flocke (Act. 20. 17. 28.) neyther dare I nor the Refuter, without better reaſon then the Doctor doth yet bring any, forſake the grammaticall ſenſe, and expound him, as ſpeaking of more then one particular congregation.</p>
                     <p>To the next queſtion, <hi>whether the Refuter (anſwer. pag. 2.) taught not, that the angels (mentioned Apoc. 1. 20.) were ſuch Biſhops or Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters as were Pastors onely of particular congregations?</hi> I anſwere, that the laſt time I talked with him, he told me, he tooke the word <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> to belong in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to all the Miniſters of the word, whether they be ſuch as are properly called Paſtors; or ſuch as are more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly named Doctors or Teachers. And therefore, when he ſaith, <hi>that the Biſhops ſignified by angels, are Miniſters, Pastors onely of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar congregations;</hi> that laſt clauſe is added to exclude, not any ſuch as have the office of Teachers in one congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but the D. Biſhops, ſuch as exerciſe a Prelacie over an whole Dioceſe; &amp; in that regard have appropriated to themſelves, the name of Angels, or Biſhops or Paſtors. And here to put in an anſwere to his ſecond ſyllogiſme, the Doctor may be pleaſed to knowe, that his skill in reaſoning much fayleth him; as will ſoone be ſeene, if his Refuter (who is as he ſaith but a ſmatterer in logick) doe but devide his one argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (as it muſt be) into two.

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, his propoſition might have paſſed without controle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: the word <hi>Paſtors</hi> being taken in a large conſtruction for all Miniſters which breake the bread of life to their people. But then he ſhould be as farre to ſeek for the proofe of that which he muſt aſſume, viz. that at Epheſus there were many angels of particular congregations; for it hath bene already ſayd, that the Refuter hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the Chriſtians of Epheſus, to be but one Church or Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, though it had many angels or Biſhops, to overſee and feed the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Now by this that hath bene ſpoken, the anſwere to his 3. que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion (or 2. as he hath ſet it downe) and of his firſt ſyllogiſme, will ask no great ſtudy or labour. For whereas he demaundeth, <hi>whether in one particular congregation there were more Pastors then one?</hi> I anſwere that the word Paſtor (being in a large ſenſe put for every one, that by his office, is bound to overſee and feed the flock over which he is ſet) may be given to many in one congregation, aſwell as the name of a Biſhop is, Actes 20. 28. Phil. 1. 1. (ſo teacheth D. Bilſon. Perpet. Govern. pag. 284. &amp; D. Whit: de Pont. Rom. pag. 351.) And in this ſenſe the Refuter taketh the word (as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore noted) when he ſaith (anſw. pag. 2. and 4.) that <hi>to be ST ARRES of heaven, and ANGELS in this kingdome, is not

                     <p>
                        <hi>The Paſtor or Byſhop of a particular congregation is but one.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>But each Angell of the Churches (ſaith the Refuter) did ſignifie a paſtor</hi>

                        <hi>or Byſhop of a particular congregation. Ergo each Angel did ſignifie but one.</hi> For the propoſition is falſe in the Refuters conſtruction of the word at large, viz. for every one that hath ſuch an office, as the Apoſtle vnderſtandeth by the word Byſhop in his writings. And though the aſſumption be true, rightly vnderſtood, yet is it falſe in the D. vnderſtanding; both words appropriated to one that is principally interreſſed (above other Miniſters of the word that are his helps and aſſiſtants) in the feeding and overſight, of any particular congregation.

Yea &amp; though he twiſe taketh notice of his reaſoning this way (pag. 31. &amp; 33.) he hath not once put one finger, towards the removing of that which is objected in this behalfe. Wherefore there is reaſon to demaund of him, 1. with what face he dareth ſuggeſt, ſo falſe a conceit into the mynde of his readers, viz. that the Refuter hath either no reaſon at all; or at leaſt no good reaſon, to vnderſtand by the Angel (in the inſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of each epiſtle) more Angels then one? And 2. why he ſhould ſo ſtiffly urge the literall ſenſe, when he hath not anſwered that which is urged to infringe it? Notwithſtanding, to move him once againe, to enter into the conſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this point, I here tender him one of the Refuters reaſons, in forme of argument, thus.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If there were more then 7. Angels in the 7. Churches; then the word Angel in the inſcription of each epiſtle, must not be taken literally, for one onely perſon, but ſynecdochically for more then one.</hi>

                     <p>

                     <p>But to proceede in the refutation of his aſſertion or aunſwere before expreſſed; ſince it is graunted there were more Angels or Byſhops then one in each of thoſe 7.

The D. affirmeth the former, and (to countenance his cauſe) putteth this difference betwene the name of <hi>an Angel</hi> or Byſhop in generall, and <hi>the Angel</hi> of this or that Church: that where there are many Miniſters in one Ch., though every one be an Angel, yet one onely that hath prehemene<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce above the reſt, is to be honored with the name of <hi>the Angel</hi> of that Church.

                     </p>
                     <p>The propoſition is the D. owne aſſertion. (ſerm. of the digni. of the Miniſters pag. 61.)</p>
                     <p>The aſſumption is his owne alſo, (in the next ſection pag. 34.)</p>
                     <p>The concluſion therefore I hope will paſſe for currant.</p>
                     <p>Moreover it is no leſſe abſurd to ſay, that this or that Miniſter is an Angel or Byſhop, but not the Angel of the Church which he overſeeth; then to ſaye, he is an Elder or Miniſter, but not an Elder or Miniſter of the Church &amp;c. 2. yea, to yeeld the name of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel ſimplie, or the Angel of the Lord, to agree fittlie to everie Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of the word, &amp; yet to reſtraine this title, <hi>the Angel of the Church</hi> to one that hath a preheminence above other Miniſters, is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive himſelfe and others by a miſtaking of the cauſe, why the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
<pb facs="tcp:14068:132"/> repreſented by the <hi>Starres,</hi> are called the Angels of their Churches, rather then the L. Angels: for the onely true cauſe is to diſtinguiſh them from the heavenly Angels, who are more uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally called, the Angels of the Lord. 3. And if theſe 2. titles be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; the name of <hi>the Lords Angel,</hi> is much better to expreſſe a prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in him, that is ſo intitled, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                        <hi>the Churches Angel;</hi> ſeing this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter debaſeth his Miniſtery, much more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the former. But as theſe names, <hi>the L. Miniſter or ſervant,</hi> and <hi>the Churches Miniſter or ſervant</hi> (Phil. 1. 1. 2. Cor. 6. 4. cum. 4. 5. and Coloſ. 1. 24. 25.) are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently taken, for one and the ſame perſon or function; ſo can there no reaſon be yeelded, why alſo theſe titles, <hi>the Lords angel,</hi> and <hi>the Churches angel,</hi> ſhould be devided into ſeverall functions.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, if neyther the ſingularitie of the number, doe argue a ſingular perſon; nor the right reaſon of the whole title, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth a preheminence in one above others, ſeing it is graunted, that there were many Angels; and proved that the title here uſed, is (in regard of the ſignification of the phraſe) co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to all; the D. hath no reaſon to ſay, that his Refuter doth without reaſon (yea good reaſon) forſake the literal ſenſe of the number.</p>
                     <p>But albeit enough hath bene ſaid to ſhew that this title: <hi>The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel</hi>

                        <hi>of the Church,</hi> is to be taken for the whole ſocietie of Miniſters in every Church; rather then for one ſingular perſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſet in a ſingular preheminence above the reſt; yet to ſatiſfie thoſe which perhaps may demaunde, why the Sonne of God ſhould give in charge to Iohn, to write vnto <hi>the angel,</hi> as one; rather then to <hi>the angels,</hi> as to many; it ſhal not be amiſſe to add this that followeth. 1. I grant that as the number of the Churches particularly named, fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth to the 7. golden candleſticks, which repreſented thoſe Churches: ſo it was very fit, the epiſtles directed to the Angels of thoſe Churches, ſhould in their inſcriptions, proportionate the number of the Angels, to the number of the ſtarres, by which thoſe Angels were ſhadowed: which could not have bene, if there had bene expreſſe mention of more Angels then one, in each in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription. Notwithſtanding as it were abſurd, from the preciſe number of 7.

Their vnitie in the Miniſteriall fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, &amp; joynt commiſſion to attend vpon the feeding and gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of one Church, (which ought to be acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panied with a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> care, and joynt labour, as it were with one hand, and heart or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, to further the Lords work in the peoples ſalvation) is much more fitly declared, by the name of one Angel, then of many; if we obſerve the phraſe of ſpeach, uſed elſe-where by the Holy Ghoſt, and in other names or titles, to the like purpoſe. We often find the name of (one) prophet, (Ier. 6. 13. and 18. 18. Eſai. 3. 2. Hoſ. 9. 8.) or Preiſt, Ier. 6. 13. and 18. 18. Ezech. 7. 26. Hoſ. 4. 6.

                     <p>3 Neyther need it ſeeme ſtrange to us, that a multitude or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Miniſters, ſhould be vnderſtood vnder the name of one <hi>Angel;</hi> ſeing a multitude of heavenly Angels (imployed in one ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for the good of Gods Saints) is ſometymes in the ſcripture ſhut up, vnder one Angel in the ſingular nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, as may be gathered from Gen. 24. 7. 2.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Therefore, the name of angels (Apoc. 1. 80.) is a peculiar ſtile belonging to one, that hath ſingular preheminence above the reſt of the Miniſters in thoſe Churches; that is, to a dioceſan Biſhop.</hi> And conſequently, the name of Angels (Apoc. 1. 20.) is given to dioceſan Byſhops, in regard of theire epiſcopall ſuperioritie above other Miniſters, in the ſame Churches, whereof they were Angels.

For, beſides that which is before delivered, to ſhew that ſome titles, belonging in common to all Miniſters, are and may be given, <hi>kat hexochen,</hi> to one onely among many, (which argueth that the giving of a title <hi>kat hexochen</hi> to one, doth not prove the ſame to be a peculiar ſtile belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging to one that hath a ſingular preheminence above others: this may be added, (which was alſo before obſerved) that if it ſhould be graunted, that ſuch a title is a peculiar ſtile, belonging to one, that hath a ſingular pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence above others; yet from hence to inferre, that it is a ſtile peculiar to a dioceſan Byſhop (to uſe the Doct. words againe) is as ridiculous, as if a man ſhould ſay, it is a bird, therefore a black ſwan: or thus, Mr. Dow. amonge many Miniſters is a Doctor, therefore he is a Duke, a Deane, a By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, or Archbyſhop.

                     <p>
                        <hi>But the first is true.

                     <p>But 4. becauſe in his latter argument the D. concludeth not that aſſertion, which his Refuter before contradicted: it ſhall not be amiſſe to ſee, if his laſt concluſion, will neceſſarily inferre it, by way of conſequence. For though he be a Doctor, and his Refuter but a ſmatterer in logicke, as he ſayth; yet ſhall he doe him that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour this once. And therefore if he will attempt it, he muſt argue to this effect.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Whatſoever name or title is a peculiar ſtile belonging to one that hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingular preheminence above other Ministers in any Church or countrie; the ſame is given to that one, in respect of that preheminence.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>But the name of Angels (Apoc. 1. 20.) is a peculiar ſtile, belonging to one, that had the preheminence of a dioceſan Byſhop, in each of the 7. Churches. Therefore, the name of Angels, is there given to one onely di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>The falſehood of this aſſumption being already layd open; it ſhall ſuffice to ſhew the vnſoundnes of the propoſition; for which purpoſe obſerve wee theſe fewe inſtances. Firſt, The name of an Apoſtle given to Paul ſo often in the epiſtles is a title pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to him, who was one, that had a ſingular preheminence
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:14068:138"/> above all other Miniſters in that Church or countrie where he converſed, when he wrote thoſe epiſtles. 2. So alſo is the name of a Miniſter of the goſpell Epheſ. 3. 6. 7. and 3. the name of a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner in the L, Epheſ. 4. 1. and 3. 1. 4. the like may be ſayd for the title which Peter giveth himſelfe 1 Pet. 5. 1. yet, were it abſurd, to think that any one of theſe titles were given to Paul or Peter, in reſpect of that preheminence, which each of them had above other Miniſters in the places where they converſed.</p>
                     <p>Thus we ſee, that whiles the D. ſtriveth to convince his Refuter <note place="margin">While the D. ſeeketh to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>vince his Refute<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For it is but a private fancie, peculiar to the D. and ſome fewe others, whereby they would faine perſwade the world, that theſe Angels were dioceſan Byſhops like to ours; &amp; as vaine is it, as private. For the Refut: may graunt all that Mr. Beza &amp; D. Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds ſay; and yet ſtill deny, that the name of angel is gvien to the preſident onely, or excluſivè, as if the reſt of his fellowe Miniſters had no right to that title with him.</p>
                     <p>As for his idle digreſſion, in aſſaying (pag. 34.) to ſhew againſt Beza, that the preſident had a perpetuitie in the preſidencie; it is not worth worth the anſwering; being as weakly mainteyned, as it is here vnſeaſonably inſerted. For although we give vnto Timothy (being an Evangeliſt) a ſtanding preſidencie during his aboad at Epheſus; yet the D. reaſoneth abſurdly, when he inferreth that ſuch as ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him in the preſidencie, had the like perpetuitie therein; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he could prove their miniſterial function to be (as Timothyes was) ſuperior to other Presbyters.</p>
                     <p>No leſſe abſurd is his reaſoning, when he vndertaketh to ſhewe from <hi>the testimonie of the most ancient authors in the Church, who were thoſe ſingular perſons, whom the Holy Ghost calleth the
<pb facs="tcp:14068:139"/> Angel of the Church at Epheſus, and likewiſe at Smyrna &amp;c. Oneſimus was the Paſtor of Epheſus, as Ignatius testifyeth, and Policarpus the Byſhop of Smyrna.</hi> If therefore Oneſimus was <hi>but one man, and likewiſe Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carpus; we may be bould to conclude that the angel of the Church of Epheſus, was but one ſingular perſon, and likewiſe the angel of Smyrna, and ſo of the reſt.</hi> For anſwere wherevnto I ſay, that if Ignatius or any other, had juſtifyed that Oneſimus was the onely perſon at Epheſus whome Iohn ſaluted by the name of the Angel (though it may aſwell be read, <hi>an angel,</hi> as <hi>the angel)</hi> of that Church, and ſo Policarpus and the reſt: the Doct: might have bene bold (not to make his bould concluſion but) to ſay, that he had one ancient au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor on his ſide in that point, though as one ſwallowe maketh no ſommer; ſo one ancient giveth him no ſufficient warrant, that he hath the conſent of the moſte ancient authors in the Church. But to make the beſt he can of Ignatius or any other, if they ſay no more for him, then as yet he hath made them (Ignatius here or others elſewhere) ſpeak, they are too mute, to miniſter reliefe to that his aſſertion; which in this 4. ſection he laboureth to mayntayn as we ſhall have occaſion further to affirme when we come to the laſt Chap. of this booke, wherein that he ſaith here concerning Oneſimus and Polycarp, (being againe repeated by him. lib. 4. pag. 40. with ſome addition) ſhalbe further debated.

But what need words be multiplied in ſo plaine a caſe? Affirmeth he not himſelfe (ſerm. pag. 22.) <hi>that the pariſhes were not yet diſtinguiſhed, nor Miniſters aſſigned to their ſeverall Cures?</hi> And muſt he not then vnderſtand thoſe Presbyrerians (with whome he pretendeth to have agrement) to ſpeak of ſuch a Presbyterie, as had the charge of one onely Church, not yet divided into ſeverall titles?

                     <p>To come therefore to the propoſition; becauſe the Refuter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected it as falſe, I will make good his cenſure both by removing <note place="margin">Sect. 2.</note> the D defence thereof, &amp; by propoſing ſome other juſt exceptions againſt it. And 1. he cannot prove every preſident of a Presbytery in the Apoſtles times to be a Byſhop; (much leſſe a dioceſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Byſhop) in the uſual conſtruction of the word, oppoſed to other Miniſterial functions. For if ſome Presbyteries were a company of Apoſtles &amp; Apoſtolicall men, who were more then Byſhops (as he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth. (ſerm. pag. 38. and def. lib. 3. pag. 81.) needs muſt their preſident be more then a Byſhop. And who doubteth, but that, as Iames the Apoſtle was preſident not onely of the Synode Act. 15. but alſo of the ſtanding Presbyterie, Act. 21. 18? And Timothe an Evangeliſt preſident among the Presbyters at Epheſus for the time of his ſtaye there, by S. Paules appointment 1. Tim. 1. 3. ſo alſo every Apoſtle, and Evangeliſt in the abſence of the Apoſtles, was the preſident of any Church where they made their reſidence, though but for a ſhort continuance. Thus was Paul the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident of that Presbyterie, which impoſed hands on Timothe, (2. Tim. 1. 6. cum. 1. Tim. 4. 14.) &amp; of the Epheſian Presbyterie

For it were abſurd, either to ſeclude him from all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation with the clergie of that Church; or to make him inferior vnto any of them. And ſince the D. acknowledgeth, that ſo longe as there remained any Apoſtles, or Evangeliſts, or Apoſtolical me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they were the governors of the Churches (lib. 4. pag. 72.) we have reaſon to thinke, that he cannot without contradiction, affirme in generall of all the preſidents that moderated the firſt Presbyteri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s, that they were properly Byſhops; for he accounteth none of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles to be properly Byſhops, (lib. 4. pag. 57.) and he ſubſcribeth (ſerm. pag 86.) to the ſaying of Tertullian (de preſcrip: adv: haere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>.) that in the Apoſtolick Churches, theyre firſt Byſhop had for their founder and Anteceſſor, one of the Apoſtles or Apoſtolik men. Now if all the preſidents of Presbyteries were not properly By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops; how could they all be dioceſan Byſhops, yea ſuch as our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oceſans are? 2. Certeinly the verie name of a preſident, that had a Presbyterie adjoyned to him, for the managinge of Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cauſes, doth ſtrongly argue the forme of Church-government then, to have neerer affinity with an Ariſtocracy, (ſuch as other reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches have reſtored) then with a Monarchy, which our dioceſans holde.

                     <p>The aſſumption of both is the ſame, that the D. maketh uſe of for a contrary concluſion. The propoſition of the former, if it be denied wil be thus confirmed.

                     <p>Thoſe preſidents therefore were no dioceſan Bps, ſuch as ours.</p>
                     <p>Both parts of this argument are acknowledged by the D. for the aſſumption appeareth by that which he affirmeth in particular of Iames his preſidencie, lib. 4. pag. 116. and generally of all By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops in former ages (ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And touching the propoſition; as he intimateth (ſerm, pag. 97. and def. lib. 4. pag. 102.) the government of our Byſhops to be monarchicall: ſo he confeſſeth that Byſhops now have not that aſſiſtance of Presbyters, which the ancient Byſhops had (lib. 1. pag. 190.) And this confirmeth alſo the truth of that other propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the later argument: For if dioceſan Byſhops, ſuch as ours, have not any ſuch Presbyterie aſſociated to them, for advice and aſſiſtance in government; then they are not preſidents of ſuch Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries, as the ancient apoſtolick Churches enjoyed: But the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is an apparant truth and conf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For it is cleare that Mr. Beza (of whoſe conſent with him in the queſtion of dioceſes and dioceſan Byſhops he boaſteth, (lib. 1. pag. 51. and lib. 2. pag. 127.) doth hold it as neceſſary that the preſident of the paſtors of a dioceſe, ſhould have (as the reſt) his particular pariſh to attende vpon; as it is eſteemed fit, that a provinciall Byſhop ſhould be more ſpecially intereſſed in the overſight of one dioceſe.

And though it ſhould be graunted, that they were men (not woemen) which are deciphered by the name of that woman Iezabell; yet the very name argueth theire greatnes &amp; theire prevayling by their ſubtile perſwaſions (no leſſe then Iezabel did by her co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manding power) to drawe many vn to their wicked wayes.

And this is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to all the Miniſters of the word, El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Church: as appeareth by that charge which Paul giveth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to all the Elders of Epheſus, viz. to attend on the feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the flocke, and to watch againſt the danger, both of wolves entring in, and of falſe teachers ſpringing up amonge them.

Act. 15. 6. 22. 23. It is apparant therefore, that in the triall and examination, both of teachers and their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, the ſcripture knoweth no difference betweene Biſhops, and Presbyters: ſo that if Biſhops will challendge to themſelves a juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction and power of correction over Presbyters, becauſe it belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth vnto them, to trie or examine, &amp; not to ſuffer falſe teaching.

Indeed, if this were true, he might with ſome colour inferre, that the angels function, was in that reſpect like to the function of our Dioceſan Biſhops; but who ſeeth not that this plea is none other, then a mere begging of the queſtion?

Moreover, by this reply, the cauſe is as litle relieved, as if a ſhipmaſter, to ſtop one leake in the one ſide of his ſhipp, ſhould make two or three on the other ſide, more dangerous then the former.

                        <hi>Therefore, the name Lord given to them in respect of their government is a title of leſſe honour, then the other that is given in the ſame respect.</hi> Why? if both titles be given to Byſhops, in one and the ſame reſpect, doth it not rather follow (by good probabilitie) that equall honour is implyed in both? ſhould not then the D. have done better, to have fortified the conſequence of his argument, then to leave it naked as he doth? And why (neyther in this, nor in the former En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thymem) ſupplieth he not the conſequence or propoſition, which (according to his owne rules lib. 2. pag. 44.) might make a perfect ſyllogiſm? at leaſt, why doth he not fill up his compariſon, and tell us, from whoſe governme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the name of Lord (given vnto Byſhops) is borrowed? Perhaps, becauſe he ſaith (in the next clauſe of his defence) that Biſhops have that <hi>title of</hi> Lords, common to them with the Lords temporall: he would have us to conceive, that it is for that cauſe, a title of leſſe honour, then that other, which Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops have common to them, with the holy Angels of God. If this be his meaning (as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

His own words are the occaſion of drawing the former into queſtion, when he ſaith: <hi>They are not therefore civil Lords, becauſe they have the title of Lords co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to them with the Lords temporall, for who knoweth not the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction? betwene the Lords spirituall and temporal?</hi> We are not ignorant of the diſtinction, ſo often mentioned in the actes of parliament, but the D. ſeemeth not to know the right meaning and uſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
<pb facs="tcp:14068:150"/> For if the Biſhops be not civill Lords, nor their Lordſhip a civill honour, becauſe they are diſtinguiſhed from the nobles of the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, by the name of Lords ſpirituall; then it followeth that theire Lordſhip and honour annexed thereunto, is meerely ſpirituall. But it is ſo well knowne to all the world, that Biſhops doe partake with temporall Lords in all the appurtenances of civil Lordſhip and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill honour; that to deny it, were delirare cum inſanis, to plaie the madd man. The reaſon therefore, of the diſtinction retained in our lawes, is rather to ſhew the different condition of the perſons, then the diverſity of their Lordſhip; becauſe the one are ſpirituall perſons or clergie-men; and the other temporall men or lay-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.

How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be, ſince he denyeth them to be civill Lords, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth the name Lord to be given them, in regarde of the ſame government, which is implied vnder the name of, <hi>the angels of the Churches;</hi> he ſhould in reaſon, derive the Lordſhip of Byſhops, rather from Chriſts Lordſhip, which is ſpirituall, then from the dignitie of Lords temporall which is meerely civil. For if that be true which he conceiveth; Byſhops have no more affinitie with noble perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in the name of Lords: then they have with all civill Magiſtrates in the name of Paſtors. Both may be called Paſtors of the people (as he ſaith ſerm. of the dig. of Min. pag. 53.) but the Magiſtrates are Paſtors of their bodies; the Miniſters of their ſoules. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, our nobles and our Byſhops doe agree in the name of <hi>Lordes;</hi> but the one are civill Lords, the other not ſo, but ſpiritual. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as he affirmeth (ſerm. pag. 62.) Miniſters to partake with Chriſt in the name of Paſtors; becauſe, as he is the Paſtor of our ſoules; ſo they are Paſtors not of mens bodyes, but of their ſouls; ſo he maketh (or at leaſt, might from the like ground affirme) Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, to have the name of Lordes, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to them with Chriſt; ſeing as he is a ſpirituall Lord; ſo are they alſo Lords ſpirituall, and not civill. Wherefore, if wee may meaſure the greatnes
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:14068:151"/> or ſmallnes of that honour, which any titles convey vnto Miniſters, by the greater or leſſe excellencie of the perſons, with whom they, in thoſe titles, are compared: then have wee good war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to conclude, the honour included in the name of <hi>Lordes,</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed unto Biſhops; to be by ſo much greater, then that which is implied, in the other title of the <hi>Churches Angels;</hi> by how much our Lord Chriſt is greater then all angels.

For compare the name of Paſtors or ſhepheards given to Miniſters (Epheſ. 4. 11.) with Chriſt, the cheife Paſtor and great ſhepheard of the ſheepe. (1. Pet. 5. 4. &amp; Heb. 13. 20.) then is it a name of farr greater honor, then the name of Angels, or Angels of the Churches: but it is by many degrees more baſe, if it be referred to the ſhepheards that watch &amp; attend on their flocks in the feilds, from whence (in truth) it was at the firſt derived. Wherefore, it muſt be confeſſed, that there is a manifeſt falſhood infolded in the conſequence of the Doctors reaſoning.</p>
                     <p>And this ſerveth wel to juſtify the later pointe before propoſed, <note place="margin">Sect. 4.</note> ſcz. that the Doctor is deceived in judging the name of <hi>Lord,</hi> being co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to Biſhops, with Lords temporall, to be a title of leſſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, then the name, of <hi>the angels of the Churches,</hi> that hath reference to the caeleſtiall Angels. We may with much more probabilitie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that by how much it is a greater honour, to have a Lord-like government in any Church; then to have a tutorſhip, or Guardianſhip therein: by ſo much, the name of <hi>Lorde</hi> given to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, in reſpect of their government; is a title of greater honour, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other, which expreſſeth their Guardianſhip, which in ſome reſpect is allowed, to the Churchwardens of every pariſhe. For, why ſhould we not meaſure the height of that honour, which ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles doe imply, rather by the nature of that government which <note place="margin">18. The Doct. contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</note> the names import; then by the condition of the perſons or things, with which the titles doe compare the perſons ſo entituled? To end this diſpute, let the reader obſerve here a ſhrewd ſhewe of a plaine contradiction in the Doctor; for whereas nowe he graunteth the
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:14068:151"/> name <hi>Lord</hi> to be given vnto Byſhops in reſpect of theire govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and authoritie: a little after (pag. 153.) he denieththe title to be given them, with relation, but as a ſimple title with honour &amp; revere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. For how can it be a ſimple title of honour, uſed without any relation or reference vnto thoſe that are governed by them; if it be given them in reſpect of their government? And thus much for anſwer to the argument, drawen from the name of <hi>Angels</hi> in his text, to juſtifie thoſe honourable titles, of <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Lordſhip</hi> given to Byſhops.</p>

Now if this be true, (as true it is) then is it falſe to ſay as he doth (ſerm. pag. 62.) that the epiſtles of Ignatius were written betwene the 90. yeare of our Lord and 99. and that his epiſtle ad Epheſ: is a pregnant proofe that Oneſimus was the Byſhop of Epheſus when the Revelation was written as he confidentlye avoucheth, (lib. 4. pag 40). For Ignatius his death fell out, Anno 111. (as Euſeb: noteth in Chro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. &amp; Cent. 2. col. 169.) which was 14. yeares after the Revelation was written.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hoſe two motives which doe moſt uſually and not unjuſtly perſwade the Reader to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive his author, (the credit of the man, &amp; the appara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t evidence that he bringeth) have by many been thought to have united their forces in Doctor Downames defenſe. For the man himſelfe, he hath been generally accounted judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, learned, painfull, religious, ſyncere, and ingenuous, the defenſe he hath made carieth ſuch an appearance of learning, antiquity, &amp; truth with it, that not onely to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe (through too much love of his owne) but to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe others alſo, it ſeemeth not ſubject vnto any replie or refutation, ſo that, this attempt of his adverſaries in gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaying, and that ſo confidently, fully, and roundly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any fear, fainting, or ſtaggering, will doubtleſs be cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, before it be pondered.</p>
                  <p>But if ſuch thoughts can be brought to endure but the calling back a while, to the reexamining of the groundes they are built on: the hollowneſs of them will ſoone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray it ſelf. For be it graunted, that ſound learning and good conſcience is this mans praiſe and priviledge above the moſt of his fellow-champions (though this defenſe doth ſo beare it ſelfe on the former, that it giveth ſmall proof of the later) yet that doth not free him from dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous deceit and errour; eſpecially in quaeſtions of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which have on the one ſide ſo much to ſway with beſide the cauſe, and on the other, nothing but naked &amp; deſpiſed truth. Neyther can it be thought, that imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all deſire and ſearch of truth, did ſo take up his minde in all this enterprize, as that blinding praejudice had no place in it. Let the wiſe conſider &amp; give ſentence, whether he that was the ſonne of a Biſhop, the ſervant or Chaplain of a Biſhop, and that none of the beſt, the favourite alſo
<pb facs="tcp:14068:159"/> of a third Biſhop, whoſe conſecration he deſired to grace, one that ſought needily to raiſe himſelf in Biſhops favour; whether ſuch a man (I ſay) be likely to preach and write in theſe cauſes even to the overflowing of paſſion, with a minde ſo cleare and free from prejudice!</p>
                  <p>It is the moſt charitable excuſe that can probablie be affoarded to diverſe of this guiſe, that ſuch beames as thoſe are doe lie in their eyes, which hinder their ſight where the light is cleare. Nay moſt of our climers doe look ſo ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon theſe queſtions, as if their eyes ſtood cleane awry. Platerus reporteth of a Germane ſoldjer, that being ſhott in the face, he had his eye ſo turned, and his noſe ſo peir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that alwayes after his eye could ſee nothing but tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the paſſages of his noſe. Iuſt ſuch a ſhot have theſe men received fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the world; all that they ſee is thorough their noſe: and except they can ſmell ſome profit or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment by the way, their eyes will not ſerve them to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne of any thing. I affirme not this of Doct. Downame, (though he among other alehouſe jeſts which he rudely breakes upon his adverſarie, doth tell him of ſeeing to his noſe end) yet he hath alſo plainely bewrayed, that he loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked through a falſe glaſſe of his owne imagination, when viewing the ſcriptures, he ſpied ſuch a Church &amp; Biſhop in them, as in his book he tels us of. The Phyloſophers wright of certain colours, which they call <hi>intentionall,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not ſuch in deed as they ſeeme to be: as when thorough a glaſſe that is red or greene, the bodies adjoyning doe appear ſo alſo. Such a glaſſe it was without doubt that made this man to think that he ſaw an <hi>intentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi> Church and an <hi>intentionall</hi> Biſhop, that vvere dioceſan and provinciall, ſuch as the Popiſh and Engliſh are, <hi>inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally</hi> as he ſaith, though not really and truely. The Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Doctors make too too much of intention in giving of orders &amp; other ſacraments: yet that is an intention anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb facs="tcp:14068:159"/> to the words pronounced. But now we are told of an intention that the ſtate of all Churches dependeth upon, which was not expreſſed by any words; but ſo farre fecht and hardly gathered, that it giveth ſuſpition of ſuch a trick as once was taught Themiſtocles, by a man of Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia; that becauſe he might not take the tables away where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a law was engraven, he would therfore turn them upſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>downe, which was as good as to take them quite away? for when the inſtitution of a Church and Biſhop which is found in the ſcriptures may not be wholly removed, the next courſe is to give it a turne, by carying the intention to a contrary point. To ſuch ſtrange ſhiftes they muſt needs be driven, which will ſtretch the ſcriptures, as ſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> leather, with their teeth, that they may bring them to agree with humane inventions.</p>
                  <p>The vnlikelineſſe of this deviſed intention, will eaſily appeare to any, but him which hath been ſo accuſtomed to cathedrall churches, that every thing ſounds in his head to the tune of the organs that he hath heard there.</p>
                  <p>The papiſt, he telleth us (juſt as the organs goe at Rome) <note place="margin">Boz. de jur. nat. &amp; div. eccl. pot. l. 1. c. 18.</note> that the extent of a Byſhops juriſdiction is not any wayes limited, but by the Popes appointment; his power of it ſelfe indifferently reaching over all the world. Our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latiſts, they would perſwade us (to the tune of Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) that neyther Church nor Byſhop hath his bounds determined by the Pope, nor yet by Chriſt in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but left to the pleaſure of Princes, for to be caſt in one mowld with the civill ſtate. Now the plaine Chriſtian finding nothing but humane uncerteinties in eyther of theſe deviſes, he contenteth himſelfe with plaine ſong, &amp; knowing that Chriſt hath appointed Chriſtians to gather themſelves into ſuch ſocieties as may aſſemble togither for the worſhip of God, and that unto ſuch he hath given their peculiar Paſtors, he (I ſay) in his ſimplicity, calleth theſe
<pb facs="tcp:14068:160"/> aſſemblies the churches of Chriſt, and theſe paſtors his Biſhops, as for other intentions, extentions, and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, which come from men, he dares not receive them, for fear they ſhould lead him from that certainty he findeth in Chriſts inſtitution, and leave him floating amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g mens preſumptions.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, it muſt needs ſeeme ſtrange to a ſerious well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning Chriſtian, when it ſhall be told him, as theſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrall men will have it, that his paſtor whom he depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth upon at home, hath not the charge of his ſowl com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto him from Chriſt, who appointed no Biſhops nor Presbyters but Dioceſan; that the L. Biſhop vvhom he never ſavv, is properly his paſtor, the pariſh miniſter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but the Biſhops curate or vice-gerent, and therefore ſtanding no further bound then as the Biſhop appointeth; ſo that by his permiſſion he may be a non-reſident, or reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding there he may onely read divine ſervice (ſo the croſſe &amp; ſurplus be not neglected) or howſoever he makes his agreement. Will not this ſeeme uncouth to ſimple men, who have alwaies been told of a ſtraighter bond to tie their miniſters unto dutie? eſpecially when they ſhall hear on the other ſide, their ovvn dutie ſo ſtrictly urged, of keeping to their miniſter though he be but a reader, of paying al tithes to him even by Gods appointment, though he never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed him to whom they are payd? certainly if Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and Sumners brought not more terrible argumentes from the carnall courts, then D. Downame hath from holy ſcripture to prove &amp; perſwade theſe paradoxes with, there muſt a new generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ariſe, that knew not the L. nor what he hath done for Iſrael, before they would be embraced.</p>
                  <p>As for the ſcripture proofes which are gathered by him, the foundation or principall corner-ſtone of them, which he deemed to lie in his text, that is utterly daſhed in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part. Which being done, the reſt that dependeth on
<pb facs="tcp:14068:160"/> that, were ready to fall of themſelves. Yet it hath pleaſed his adverſary, for their more thorough ſcattering, in this ſecond part to give every one his ſeverall knock. A labour not neceſſary, were it not that the inſolent confidence wherevvith they are avouched, hath I knovv not how ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed and ſcared ſome vveak and fearfull mindes, but for the better bringing both of him &amp; them to themſelves againe, that courſe is taken, then which there is no ſhorter or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recter. For when the queſtion is, vvhat Church &amp; Biſhop is Apoſtolicall, the next vvay is, to ſearch the ſcriptures, &amp; hear vvhat they ſay of themſelves, before vve regard what fathers or councels doe make them ſay. D. Dovvname therefore hath no reaſon to take it unkindely (which yet I knovv he vvill) at his adverſaries hand, that he hath for evidence divided the houſe, cauſing holy ſcriptures to goe by themſelves in this ſecond part of his Reply, remitting the voices of men to the laſt place, that they alſo may ſpeak by themſelves. When divine &amp; humane ſuffrages are ſhuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled togither in one, the ſimple hearer perceiving a ſound which ſeemes glorious to him, though they be men that ſpeak, yet he is preſently ready to cry as the people did to Herod, <hi>the voice of God and not of man.</hi> In confidence of this ſtratageme, the beggerly ceremonies which we borro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed of Papiſts have been lately mainteyned as Apoſtolical.</p>
                  <p>The methode therefore which this writer hath followed, is for the readers good. His anſwers are ſuch as wil ſpeak for themſelves. Onely this I may foreſpeak, in their behalf, that if they ſeem (as in the former part I feare they will) in the logicall termes and formes of reaſoning, to be over troubleſom for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reader; the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of that blame muſt reſt vpon the defenſe, which they were bound to follow. For the defendant taking it too much in ſcorne, that his logick (wherein of all other thinges he would be thought to excel) was ſomewhat impeached by his Refuters analyſis, be did ſo vehemently ſtrive to maintaine that part of his credite, that his Refuter was forced to give him that triall which ſuch logicians truſt to. The ſtudious reader will beare with this neceſſity, and ſeek out the truth, though it lie among thornes.</p>

Yea though <note place="margin">a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in the Doct.</note> he ſhould now carrie thoſe places as the line draweth them, to the Churches of an whole nation; yet can he not eſcape the blame of an apparant contradiction, in his underſtanding of Act. 14. 27; (both places of his book compared;) beſides a groſſe overſight, in making the Church ſpoken of Act. 11. 26. &amp; 1. Cor. 11. 18. &amp;c. to be farre more large then the church mentioned. 1. Cor. 1. 2. &amp; Act. 13. 1. And 7. touching the places which he taketh to ſignifie <hi>indefinitely any company of Chriſtians</hi> &amp;c. it is ſtrange he ſhould not ſee, as definite a limitation of the place, and nation or province in Act. 9. 31. &amp; 15. 41. &amp; 1.

And yet (as if he had a diſpenſation to define what the Holy Ghoſt hath not defined) hereafter he will tell us (pag. 57.) that by <hi>Churches</hi> in the concluſion of each epiſtle (Apoc. 2. 7. 17.) &amp;c. we may very well underſtand the particular Churches, which were under the charge of every angell, to whom the epiſtles are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected.</p>

And firſt he ſaith, that by <hi>war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the word, every company of men profeſſing the faith of Chriſt, is both truely a church, &amp; alſo a true church.</hi> But it is more then he can prove, as ſhall appeare in the examination of ſome particulars following. He addeth, that <hi>as the whole company of the faithfull upon earth, is the true Church and ſpouſe of Christ: ſo alſo the company of Christians profeſſing the true faith of Chriſt, in any nation or part of the world, is to be termed by the name of a Church.</hi> The former I may grant him; but touching the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:14068:163"/> I muſt aſk, what he meaneth by this phraſe <hi>is to be termed?</hi> doth it imply a neceſſity, or onely a liberty and conveniency? If the firſt, what reaſon hath he to debarre us from reteyning the phraſe of ſpeach, which himſelfe confeſſeth (in the former page) to be uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all in the new Teſtament, namely to call the Chriſtians of an whole nation <hi>Churches</hi> in the plurall number? If the later; whence hath he his warrant? ſince he hath not (in all his table) any one place which giveth the name of a <hi>Church</hi> in the ſingular number, to the faithfull of an whole nation; ſave onely that of Act. 7. 38. which is ſpoken of the Iewiſh people, whiles they were one congregation (not yet divided into ſeverall Synagogues, or Church-aſſemblies) vnder the guidance of Moſes and Aaron in the wildernes. But he argueth a <hi>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>England, profeſſing (through Gods mercie) the true Catholike and Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like faith, is to be called the Church of England.</hi> The conſequence hereof might be denied; for why ſhould the forme and conſtitution of the Iewiſh Church vnder the law, be a more fit patterne for us to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, then that form of Church-conſtitution which was eſtabliſhed vnder the Goſpell, for the Chriſtians of all nations, both Iewes &amp; Grecians? Is there not more ſtrength in this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequence? <hi>The Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians of an whole nation are every where in the new Teſtament, called Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, &amp; no where by the name of a Church in the ſingular number: (as Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Aſia, Macedonia, Galatia, Iudea, Galile and Samaria: 1. Cor. 16. 1. 19. 2. Cor. 8. 1. Gal. 1. 2. 22. 1. Theſ. 2. 14. Act. 9. 31.) Ergo the Chriſtians, which at this day, profeſſe the faith of Chriſt in England, are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be termed the Churches, then the Church of England;</hi> eſpecially ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the number of Churches or congregations, is farre greater (in all likelihood) then the number of families was in any one nation in the Apoſtles times. Notwithſtanding, if the Doctor can (as he aſſaieth) paralell the people of England, with the Iewiſh nation in that which properly made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as ſome think one church; he might take more libertie to include them al vnder the name of the church of England. To effect this, vnto that which ſome alleadge (viz. that the Church of the Iewes was one, becauſe it was vnder one high-Preiſt, who was a figure and therefore ceaſed) the Doctor frameth a double anſwer. 1. <hi>It is evident (ſaith he) that it was one Church becauſe it was one people or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth, ruled by the ſame lawes, profeſſing the ſame
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:14068:163"/> religion; both before there was one high-Preist, and after there were through corruption more then one. 2. Neyther was the high-Preist a type of Christ in reſpect of his preheminence, and government over the Preiſts &amp; people; but in reſpect of his ſacrifice &amp; interceſſion for the whole people &amp;c.</hi> To the firſt I reply as followeth. 1. It is evident, that the Chriſtian Iewes in Iudea were one people or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wealth, ruled by the ſame lawes &amp; profeſſing the ſame religion: yet were they not one but many chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as appeareth Gal. 1. 22. and 1. Theſ. 2. 14. Act. 9. 31. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Doctor taketh that for an evident truth, which is evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">The D. ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth for truth that which is falſe.</note> falſe, in affirming that the Iewiſh Church was one becauſe they were one co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth &amp;c. 2. Neyther doe they affirme who hold the Church of the Iewes one, that their vnitie depended one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the perſon of one high preiſt; but upon Gods ordinance which combined them all (ſay they) in one body of a church; in binding them to aſſemble at times appointed, unto one taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle or temple, there to performe the parts of his worſhip in one vniforme order, under the overſight of one high preiſt, aſſiſted by inferiour Preiſts and Levites. But 3. how will the Doctor prove, that they were (as he ſaith) one co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-wealth, ruled by the ſame lawes, before they had one high-preiſt? Is not the law of their high preiſthood, as ancient as any of the lawes given by Moſes, to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle them in one forme of a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-wealth? (Exod. 28. Levit. 8. cum ſeq.) And 4. when through corruption there were two high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preiſts (Luc. 3. 2.) which executed the office by their courſes, one after another (as other preiſts did in their order) was not the whole adminiſtration &amp; exerciſe of the office in the hands of that one, which was the high-preiſt for his yeare? (Iohn 11. 49. with Act. 4. 6.) What great difference then of one high preiſt, between the time of this corruption, and that which went before it?</p>
                     <p>To the the ſecond, I anſwer, that it is an idle &amp; feeble flouriſh, <note place="margin">Sect. 3.</note> leaving the maine point of the objection untouched, and weakly performing what he undertaketh. 1. It is obſerved before, that they who in this point concurre with the Doctor, viz. that the Iewiſh Church was but one, doe hold their vnitie to ariſe, from Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, <note place="margin">The D. ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth an i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle and feeble flouriſh.</note> who conjoyned the whole nation in one ſocietie, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under one high-preiſt; but alſo in regard of one tabernacle at the firſt, &amp; after that, of one Temple, vnto which they were all bound to reſort 3. times in the yeare, there to worſhip God in ſuch ſort, as he had preſcribed. Which ordinances, viz. of one high preiſt &amp;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:14068:164"/> of one tabernacle or temple for the whole nation) are now ceaſed becauſe they were figures and types, which had their end in Chriſt. That their one high-preiſt was a figure of our one high-preiſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, is a truth ſo evident by the ſcriptures (eſpecially Heb. 3 1. and 4. 14. &amp; 5. 1. 5. &amp; 8, 1, 2. &amp; 9. 7. &amp; 10. 1. 9. 20.) that the Doctor cannot but ſubſcribe to it. And it is no leſſe evident, that the ſame Chriſt, was alſo ſhadowed out by their tabernacle &amp; tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Heb. 8. 2. and 9. 8, 9, 11, 12, 24. Ioh. 2, 19, 21. In another reſpect, one tabernacle compact togither of many parts, and one temple compoſed of many ſtones, was a figure of that one catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like church, which, as one temple or howſe, comprehendeth all the elect, as living ſtones and parts of the building. 2. Cor. 6. 16. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ. 2, 21. 22, Heb. 3. 6. 1. Pet. 2, 5. And their aſſembling togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in that one temple under the Miniſtery of that one highpreiſt, was a lively type of the gathering togither of all the elect, unto the heavenly Ieruſalem, to the generall aſſembly &amp; Church of the firſt borne written in heaven, and unto Ieſus the Mediatour of the new covenant (Heb. 12, 23, 24, 25) as ſheep which come into one folde under the overſight of one cheefe Shepheard, Iohn 10. 16. Heb. 13. 20. 1. Pet. 2, 25. There is an apparant truth therefore in that which the Doctor propoſeth as a frivolous allegation, viz. that theſe legal ordinances were figures and therefore are ceaſed; eſpecially ſeing, it is held that there is neyther any one nationall Biſhop anſwering in degree of office and preheminence unto their one high preiſt; nor any one nationall temple unto which the generall body of the people doe reſort for the practiſe of Gods evangelicall worſhip. And though the Doct. may perhaps, give allowance unto the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; yet I ſuppoſe he will not eaſily acknowledge the later, to be fit for the times of the goſpell.</p>
                     <p>2. All that the Doctor ſaith, is no more but this; he denieth the high Preiſt to be a type of Chriſt in reſpect of his preheminence &amp; government over the Preiſts and people. What meaneth the Doct? neyther in reſpect of preheminence? no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> yet of government? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like then, he was a type of Chriſt; quatenus a Preiſt; but not as a high Preiſt? yet as the ſcripture (Heb. 9. 7. 8. 11. 12. 24.) ſo the D. acknowledgeth that the high Preiſt figured Chriſt; by his entra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce alone into the ſanctuarie, which none other Preiſt might doe: how then can he deny that he prefigured Chriſt in the reſpect of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence which was peculiar to his office? and why not alſo in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:14068:164"/> reſpect of his government; over Preiſts and people in things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyning to God? what meaneth elſe that name of <hi>great high-Preist;</hi> and <hi>great Preist</hi> ſet over the houſe of God? Heb. 4. 14. and 10. 20. But 3. let us heare the D. reaſons, why he thinketh that the high-Preiſt was no type of Chriſt in reſpect of preheminence or govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Forſooth <hi>then had he aſwell as Melchiſedeck, been a type of Chriſts government and Kingly office, aswell as of the Preiſthood: and conſequently Christ might have been a Preist of the order of Aaron aswell as of Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedech.</hi> And a little after; <hi>Chriſts government apperteineth to his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and not to his preiſt hood.</hi> As if all preheminence and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were peculiar to princes, &amp; inſeparably annexed to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly office? Surely if Chriſt have no preheminence nor government in his Church, as he is our Prophet and Preiſt; but onely as he is King; then is he in theſe Offices conſidered a parte, inferior to all other Prophets and Preiſts that had their part in eccleſiaſticall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. But how can he be a <hi>great Preiſt over the Houſe of God</hi> (Heb. 10 21) and ſit not onely as a <hi>King,</hi> but alſo as a <hi>Preist</hi> upon his throne; (Zach 6, 13) and yet have no manner of government by his preiſtly function? Wherefore the government now inveſted in Chriſt, might be (yea undoubtedly was) figured a part aſwell by the eccleſiaſticall government of the high-preiſts ſucceeding Aaro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; as by the civil government of David and the Kings that ſate on his throne. I conclude then that the Leviticall high-preiſt was a type of Chriſt, in reſpect of his eccleſiaſticall preheminence and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: although his principalitie and regall government, joyning in one with the preiſtly function, was rightly figured (not in Aaro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but) in Melchiſedek. And, although the conjoyning of both theſe preheminences togither in Chriſt, was alſo praeſigured, in Iehoſhua <note place="margin">The D. pro poſeth a weak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence and a falſe antecedent to juſtifie an untruth</note> an high preiſt of Aarons line, (Zach. 6, 11, 13.) yet it were groſſe ignorance in the groundes of divinitie from hence to inferre, that therefore Chriſt might have bene a Preiſt after the order of Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua (or Aaron) aſwell as of Melchiſedeck. It is apparant then, that the Doctor hath propoſed both a weak conſequence, and a falſe antecedent; to juſtify the untruth of his frivolous exception.</p>
                     <p>Thus have we ſeen what ſucceſſe the Doctor hath had, in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour <note place="margin">Sect. 4.</note> to prove, that the name of a <hi>Church</hi> in the ſingular num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, is to be given vnto the people of an whole nation profeſſing the faith, though divided into many thowſand particular Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; He proceedeth to tell us, that <hi>likewiſe the Chriſtian people of any Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:14068:165"/> or country adjoyning, whether that which we call a province or dioceſe, though conſiſting of many particular congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s; is rightly termed a Church; as the Church of Ieruſalem, Antioch, Epheſus, Smyrna, Sardis, Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phis &amp;c.</hi> I confeſſe, that this latter, hath a like right and title, to the name of a Church, with the former: to wit, by the cuſtome of ſpeach &amp; humane ordinance; ſubjecting the particular Churches of an whole countrie or nation, to one Dioceſan or Provinciall Biſhop, or to one nationall Synode: But I deny, that the ſcripture doth give any more allowance vnto the one, then to the other: &amp; I doubt not but his proofes for the later, will be found as weak as the former. To drawe his wordes before ſet downe, into an orderly forme of reaſoning; they muſt run in this faſhion or the like. <hi>Such a company of Chriſtians as anſwereth in Church-conſtitution to the Church of Ieruſalem, Antioch, Epheſus &amp;c. mencioned in the Scriptures, is rightly ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a Church: But the Chriſtian people of any Citie &amp; Country adjoyning, though conſiſting of many particular congregations, whether in a province or dioceſe anſwereth in Church-conſtitution to the Church of Ieruſalem, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch, Epheſus &amp;c. mencioned in the ſcripture. Therefore, the Christian people of any Citie and country adjoyning, though conſiſting of many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar congregations, whether in a province or dioceſe; is rightly termed a Church.</hi> Here the aſſumption is a meere begging of the queſtion, for he is <note place="margin">The Doct. beggeth the queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The contrary whereof may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from his owne poſitions in his ſermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; the defenſe thereof.

                        </gap>ib. 2. pag. 69. and 121.) that pariſhes were not diſtinguiſhed in the Apoſtles times. And as here (in the next ſection, pag 6) he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth that at the firſt converſion of Cities, the whole num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of people converted, were able to make but a ſmall congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? ſo he granteth afterwards (cap. 6. pag. 104.) that the moſt of the Churches, during the time of S. Paul, did not, each of them, exceed the proportion of a populous congregation. Yet in Pauls

Wherefore ſtill there remayneth this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, betweene our dioceſan and provinciall Churches, and thoſe Apoſtolike Churches mencioned in the ſcriptures (as the Church at Ieruſalem, Antioch, Epheſus and the like) that congregations or pariſh aſſemblies, were not multiplied in them, as now they are in ours; ſo that the name of a <hi>Church,</hi> given in the ſcripture to the one, doth not prove that it may be alſo rightly allotted to the other.</p>

For though he ſpeake here doubtfully <hi>(with a perhaps)</hi> yet afterwards he ſaith certeinly it was a pariſh. (pag. 104. following) 4. And there is required (beſides the profeſſion of the true faith) the Miniſtery of the word and ſacraments and ſome good order of government, to make the Chriſtians of any citie towne or family a true viſible Church.

His meaning is (as afterwards he ſheweth) that a Biſhop and his presbyterie may not be had in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very pariſh: it ſufficeth if they be ſeated in the citie, and that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular pariſhes in citie and country, doe partake the effect and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of their government.

Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding I deny not, but it were as abſurd to deſire a Biſhop and Presbytery in every pariſh (that is to ſay, ſuch a Lord Biſhop as ours are, and ſuch a Presbytery as are the Deane and Prebends of our cathedrall Churches) as to require for every village, a Major and Aldermen, of that ſtate, that they beare at this day in the citie of London.

But til this be done, though he write ten volumes more, and each of them ten times greater then this: yet he ſhall never be albe to convince the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience of his indifferent reader in the point which he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taketh to prove; to wit, <hi>that the Apostolicall</hi> Churches were proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (and if not actually yet at leaſt intentionally) dioceſes &amp; not pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes.</p>
                     <p>But though he cannot fortify his owne aſſertion, yet will he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay <note place="margin">Sect. 7. ad ſect. 5. pag 7.</note> to throw downe their hold that oppugne it, with this jolly En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thymem: <hi>The word Eecleſia ſignifi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:14068:167"/> uſe of the word in the ſcripture doth not ſavour their conceit, which i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>magine there is no true Church, but a pariſh.</hi> Wherein he doth neyther right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">The D. in one Enthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mem, ſani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth 2.</note> ſet downe their aſſertion; nor aſſume a cleare truth to refute it. The firſt appeareth by H. I his table (pag 6. of his book whereto the Doctor pointeth) in that, beſides a particular congregation of Chriſtians meeting for religious exerciſes (which the Doct. calleth a pariſh) he acknowledgeth the name of Church to be given in the ſcriptures, vnto ſome other ſocieties, viz. the Catholike milita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Church on earth; the inviſible ſociety of Gods elect, abſolutely Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike; the people of a particular co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregation conſidered without and beſides their Miniſters; and the company of a Chriſtian fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie. The truth is, he holdeth the onely true viſible Church, indow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Chriſt with the ſpirituall power of order and government in it ſelfe, to be none other then a particular congregation. Neyther is the truth hereof infringed, by that which the Doctor aſſumeth: ſeing the name of a Church given at large, to any company of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in regard of their profeſſion of the true faith, cannot prove the power of Eccleſiaſticall government to belong vnto every ſuch company of <hi>Christians,</hi> or to any other ſociety, then one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar congregation. 2. But he aſſumeth for a grounded truth, that <note place="margin">The D. reaſoneth ex non co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſis.</note> which he ſhall never be able to juſtify: when he ſaith <hi>that the word eccleſia ſignifyeth (according to the uſuall phraſe of the Holy Ghost) any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Chriſtians, great or ſmall.</hi> For he cannot ſhewe any one place of ſcripture, where the word <hi>Church</hi> in the ſingular number is give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſuch a multitude of Chriſtians in an whole Nation Province or Dioceſe, as was diſtributed into many particular congregations. Yea his own table (page 4.) ſheweth that when the ſcripture ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of the Chriſtians in an whole nation, it calleth them <hi>Churches</hi> plurally (and not by the name of a <hi>Church</hi> ſingularly) as Churches of Galatia, Aſia, Macedonia. 1. Cor. 16. 1. 19. 2. Cor. 8. t. Gal. 1. 2. And the like phraſe of <hi>Churches</hi> is uſed for the Chriſtians of one province. Act. 9. 31. <hi>the Churches had reſt throughout all Iudea, Galile and Samaria.</hi> Wherefore to let the Doctor ſee how little the uſe of the word favoureth his conceit of Dioceſan Churches &amp;c. I will this once tender him this argument. <hi>The word eccleſia in the ſingular number, doth no where note ſuch a number of Christians as is divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into many particular congregations in any dioceſe, nation or province. Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, the uſe of the word in the ſcripture favoureth not their concest which ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that the Christians of an whole Nation, Province or Dioceſe, though
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:14068:168"/> diſtributed into many congregations may not with ſtanding (by the warrant of the word) be rightly termed one Church.</hi> Yea it ſerveth, rather to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute then to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firm, the point now in queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, viz. that the 7. Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches (me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cioned in this text) were properly Dioceſes &amp; not Pariſhes.</p>
                     <p>As for his large diſcourſe touching the diverſe ſignifications of theſe words, <hi>Eecleſia, Paraecia, Diaeceſis,</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly tranſlated, <hi>Church, Pariſh, Dioceſe</hi> (how they are taken in the ancient writers) I ſee not what advantage he can make by it to conclude the queſtion. The ſumme of all that he ſaith, is this; In ancient writers, Eccleſia, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roecia &amp; Dioeceſis, having refere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to a Biſhop, &amp; his whole charge, doe ſignify a Dioceſe and not a pariſh. Which how true it is I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not now enquire, vnleſs I ſhould digreſſe into a new controverſy. For the preſent it ſhall ſuffice to obſerve, that though it were gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be true, yet it will not juſtify his aſſertion; that the 7. Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Aſia mencioned in his text, were properly dioceſes, &amp; not pariſhes; for in the conſequence of his reaſoning (if he ſhall ſo ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue) he beggeth the queſtion in two particulars, which he ſhould <note place="margin">The Doct. beggeth the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in 2. particulars</note> (but cannot) make evident, by good demonſtration: viz. that in his text, the word <hi>Eceleſia,</hi> hath reference to one Biſhop and his charge; and that it carrieth the ſame ſignification (for the ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity or plurality of particular congregations comprized within it) which it doth in thoſe ancient writers whom he citeth. Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving therefore this whole diſcourſe, and overpaſſing alſo his 2.

                     <p>We have already heard in the former part, how feebly the D. argueth to prove the 7. Churches of Aſia, to be great and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:14068:168"/> ample citie togither with the countries adjoyning; when he ſaith, it cannot be denied, but they were ſuch becauſe our Saviour, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Churches of Aſia numbreth but 7; and nameth the principall, ſome whereof were Mother cities. He addeth imediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after, <hi>For it is evident that the Apoſtles when they intended to convert any nation, they first preached to the cheiſe cities thereof. Wherin, when through Gods bleſſing, they had converted ſome, their manner was to ordeyne Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, hoping by their Ministery to convert not onely the reſt of the citie but alſo the countries adjoyning, ſo many as did belong to God.</hi> Which words the Refuter (anſw. pag.) carried as the 2. reaſon to conclude the point before queſtioned: becauſe (finding the former argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to be ſo obſcure and vnfitting as it is before ſhewed to be) he judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it in effect all one to ſay, <hi>It cannot be denied but the 7. Churches, were great &amp; ample cities</hi> &amp;c. for it is evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that the Apoſtles in the cheife cities of any nation, where they had converted ſome to the faith, did uſually ordeine Presbyters, by their Miniſtery to convert the reſt of the citie and country adjoyning: and to tranſpoſe the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences in this manner: It is evident that the Apoſtles in the cheife cities of every nation, where they had converted ſome to the faith, did uſually ordeine presbyters &amp;c. Ergo, it cannot be denyed but the 7. Churches were great and ample Cities &amp;c. But the D. ſaith, his analyſis <hi>miſtake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to ſay no worſe,</hi> as if he could have juſtly laid an heavier fault upon his Refuter; if he had not favoured him. And in deed, he loadeth him with a fouler imputation, when (after in the ſame page) he ſaith that (in digeſting his words before expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, into a connexive ſyllogiſme) he <hi>framed a propoſition for the nonce to cavill withall.</hi> A raſh cenſure, the leſs to be regarded, becauſe the Refuter may ſafely appeale to Gods owne tribunall, who knoweth that he dealt ſyncerely; and was led by the connection of both ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to conceive the meaning to be ſuch as is before ſhewed. But he ſhould (ſaith the Doctor) have <hi>looked to the end of that which he made the 3. ſect. where he ſhould have found this to be the maine concluſion of all that followeth the first argument (concerning the 7. Churches) to that place. viz. that the Preſbyters in the Apoſtles times, were not appointed to pariſhes but to dioceſes.</hi> But he thought it needleſſe to carrie the word <hi>for</hi> ſo farre; when there was need of help to prove the point afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going. Notwithſtanding, let him walk in his owne way, I doubt not, but to make it appeare, that the argument and the proſyllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſmes thereof framed by himſelfe, doe diſcover both his owne
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:14068:169"/> miſtaking of his Analyſis (to ſay no worſe) and the weaknes of his arguing, aswell now in this defenſe, as before in the ſermon itſelf. The maine concluſion to which he ſendeth us, hath theſe words (ſerm. pag. 18. lin: ult. &amp;c. <hi>The Preſbyteries therefore in the Apostles times, were appointed, not to feverall pariſhes, but to whole cities, &amp; the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                     <p>So then it appeareth, that in the words of his ſermon before <note place="margin">Sect. 2.</note> going pag 18. 19. we are to expect the proofe of theſe. 5. points (for elſe he ſtretcheth his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beyond the bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of the premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which ſhould inferre it) viz. 1. the Presbyteries ordeyned by the Apoſtles, were not appointed to ſeverall pariſhes. 2. they were appointed to whole cities &amp; the countires adjoyning. 3. thoſe cities &amp; countries were Dioceſes. 4. one end of that their appointmet, was to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>vert &amp;c. 5. the other end was to attend &amp; feed the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.

The former it ſeemeth he took for graunted; and therefore now coupling the two firſt togither, he ſetteth them downe in this manner. <hi>The Preſbyteries ordeyned by the Apostles, were not appointed to pariſhes but to dioceſes;</hi> the other was wiſely concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, becauſe there is not one word in his ſermon to make it good; though it be of the greateſt moment for his purpoſe: In deed, he had ſayd before, that the Presbyters were in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to attend the whole flock converted, feeding them with the word &amp; ſacraments; and to labour the converſion of the reſidue &amp;c. but how great a difference there is betweene theſe two ends of the Miniſtery of the Presbyters, ordeyned by the Apoſtles; and thoſe that his conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mencioneth; it is eaſy for the ſimpleſt of his Readers to diſcern, Whether the change were made unwittingly, or of purpoſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,

                        </gap>luſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (whatſoever it was at the firſt) is now co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prized in this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound axlome before delivered. <hi>The Preſbyteries ordeyned by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were not appointed to pariſhes but to dioceſes;</hi> which he maketh the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent of a Enthymem, to inferre the principal queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (touching dioceſan Churches in general) viz. Therefore the Churches indued with power of eccleſiaſticall government, were not pariſhes but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oceſes. The Antecedent (he ſaith) is proved by two arguments; the firſt whereof (not to ſpeak now of the propoſition which he omitted) lieth in this ſentence. The Presbyteries ordeyned by the Apoſtles, were appointed for whole cities &amp; countries thereto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing, to labour ſo farre as they were able, the converſion of all that belonged unto God. And to the confirmation of this he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth all that which his Refuter carried an other way. <hi>For it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the Apostles, when they intended to convert any nation, firſt prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to the cheife cities thereof &amp;c.</hi> to the words, <hi>neyther were the pariſhes.</hi> Which halfe perſwadeth me, that he hath borrowed his firſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the proofe of the Antecedent, from the ſecond &amp; fourth points (before noted to be couched) in that concluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> delivered in his ſermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For other wiſe his analyſis cutteth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> off fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as ſuperfluous branches; &amp; maketh his firſt argument to be Cryp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically inwrapped under the confirmation thereof. Now if it were borrowed thenee; then the wordes following (ſerm. pag. 18. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were the pariſhes diſtinguiſhed &amp;c) in all equitie ſhould be, not a ſecond argument, to confirme his firſt antecedent; but rather a new proſyllogiſme to juſtify the generall proofe thereof. To co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, whenceſoever he derive it; there is ſo ſmall a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Medius terminus of his firſt argument, with both the proſyllogiſmes ſet to uphold it: &amp; the wordes which in his ſecond argument are of greateſt force (as he ſaith pag. 70. of this defence) to prove that the persbyteries were appointed to Dioceſes: that they are little better (when he hath made the beſt that he can of them) then a beggerly repetition of one thing, or a proving of the ſame by the ſame. So that we may well think, if his Refuter ſhould <note place="margin">The Doct. proveth i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem per idem.</note> have contrived his arguments ſo as himſelf hath done, he would have bene as readie as now he is to charge him with miſtaking his Analyſis.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:14068:170"/> But let him make the beſt advantage of his owne Analyſis; &amp; let us trie the valour of his ſyllogiſmes, which he profereth to our <note place="margin">Sect. 3.</note> view. And firſt of that Enthymeme, which concludeth the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall queſtion in this manner;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Preſbyteries ordeyned by the Apoſtles, were appointed not to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes but to Dioceſes. Therefore the churches indued with power of ecoleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall government were not pariſhes but Dioceſes. This conſequence,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the Refuter granteth, ingranting the connexive propoſition of the Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſme, which he fremeth, pag. 58. of the anſwer. If he did not, it might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be confirmed, by adding the aſſumption. viz. To viſible Churches in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with power of eccleſisſticall government, the Preſbyters ordeyned by the Apoſtles were appointed.</hi> Loe here the D. reaſoning; now what if the adding of this aſſumption, utterly marreth the faſhion of his argument? hath he not then ſpent his labour well to diſcover his owne heedleſſe overſight, to ſay no worſe? for had he well peruſed the parts, he might have found 5. termes in his ſyllogiſme. viz. 1. <note place="margin">The D. hath 5. germes, in one ſyllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſme.</note> Presbyteries ordeyned by the Apoſtles. 2. appointed to Dioceſes not to pariſhes. 3. appointed to viſible Churches indued with pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of eccleſiaſticall government. 4. the Churches (themſelves) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with ſuch power. 5. Dioceſes and not Pariſhes. To redreſſe this groſſe fault; if ſo ſimple a Scholler as the Refuter might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to give any direction, to ſo great a Clerk as Mr. D. me thinks he ſhould have done well, to have exchanged the Antecedent of his Enthymeme, with ſome Propoſition in ſenſe equivalent that might have yeilded the ſame predicatum, which his concluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth, as thus; The Churches, to which the Presbyteries ordeined by the Apoſtles were appointed, were properly dioceſes (ſuch as ours) and not pariſhes. Or thus; Dioceſes (ſuch as ours) and not pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes, were the whole and onely charge of the Presbyteries ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Apoſtles. The aſſumption then to be added, muſt be one of theſe; viz. The Churches which in the Apoſtles times were indued with the power of eccleſiaſticall government were thoſe vnto which the Presbyteries ordeyned by them, were appointed. Or thus; The Churches which the Apoſtles indued with power of eccleſiaſticall government were the whole &amp; onely charge of thoſe presbyteries which they ordeyned. So the concluſion would natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally flow from theſe premiſſes, to wit; Therefore, the Churches which the Apoſtles indued (or were indued in their times) with the power of eccleſiaſticall government, were Dioceſes properly
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:14068:170"/> (ſuch as ours) &amp; not pariſhes; which of theſe ſoever he ſhall chooſe; the propoſition is to be refuſed, as utterly falſe. Againſt the Aſſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption (whether former or later) I have nothing to except. This onely I ſay, if the Doctor ſhall diſlike the later, as too narrowly li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited by thoſe wordes, <hi>whole &amp; onely charge.</hi> I muſt then tell him, his ſyllogiſme is alſo herein deceitfull and faultie; that his propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſpeaketh of <hi>an appointment,</hi> differing from that which he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in his Aſſumption; the feeding and governing of the viſible Churches being but a part (yea the leaſt part) of the charge of thoſe Presbyteries; in aſmuch as he ſuppoſeth, they were appointed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, to an other more principall work, viz. to labour the converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſuch as were yet enemies to the faith and not members of the Churches. But if he will acknowledge the viſible Churches, to be the whole and onely charge of the Prebyteries ordeyned by the Apoſtles; then the premiſſes of his ſyllogiſme doe make warre, the one againſt the other. For the aſſumption ſo underſtood, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly croſſeth the aſſumption and the fortifications thereof, which are (pag. 65.) fitted to confirme the Propoſition or Antecedene of his maine argument; and conſequently, through their ſides, it pearceth the hart of the propoſition itſelf. For if the viſible chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches indued with power of eccleſiaſtical goverme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, were the whole &amp; onely charge of the presbyteries ordeyned by the Apoſtles; then were they not appointed for the converſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the reſt of the citie &amp; countrie: neither was that work the end or motive that ſwayed the Apoſtles to ordeyn them. So that his propoſition (which affirmeth that thoſe presbyteries were appointed for whole Dioceſes) hath nothing to ſupport it.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, if he ſhall diſlike the limitation which I have added to his propoſition, reſtreyning it to ſuch Dioceſes as ours are, or at leaſt to ſuch Dioceſes, as were alſo Churches: he is to know that his conſequence is naught, and ſuch as of which he hath no graunt from his refuter to boaſt of. For unleſſe it be preſuppoſed, that the Dioceſes, to which he ſaith, the Presbyteries were appointed, were Churches, and like to our dioceſan Churches; his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wilbe deceitfull alſo in a ſecond reſpect; to wit, becauſe his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent and the concluſion ſpeak, not of one kind of Dioceſes; but of ſuch as differ toto genere, (if the one be churches and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not ſo) or at leaſt in ſpecie, if they be Dioceſan Churches un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to ours. For (as is heretofore noted) Dioceſan Biſhops like to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:14068:171"/> ours, doe require the Churches where of they are Biſhops, to be dioceſes, (or dioceſan Churches) like to ours. This memoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum therefore being premiſed (that by Dioceſes in his propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we are to vnderſtand Dioceſan Churches like to ours) we are come to examine the firſt of his two arguments, which himſelf fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to prove the propoſition before denyed in manner &amp; forme following;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>They who were appointed to whole cities and countries to labour ſo farre at <note place="margin">Sect. 4.</note> they were able; the converſion of all that, belonged to God; were appointed to Dioceſes, and not to Pariſhes. But the Preſbyteries ordeyned by the Apostles were appointed for whole cities and countries thereto belonging, to labour ſo farre as they were able, the converſion of all that belonged to God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Therefore the Preſbyteries ordeyned by the Apostles, 3: 44 PM 5/7/2011 were appointed not unto Pariſhes, but unto Dioceſes, that is, to Dioceſan Churches, like to ours. This Propoſition,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I omitted as taking it for granted.</hi> Be it ſo; yet ſince he ſaw, that his Refuter eſteemed the conſequence weake of that argum: he framed to a concluſion ſomewhat differing, he mought wel have bene jealous of his rejecting this propoſition al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. For ſince the Presbyters of which he ſpeaketh were planted in the cheife cities of ſuch a nation, as the Apoſtles deſired to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>vers; what hindreth but the countreyes annexed might be Provinces, or rather whole Nations, and not Dioceſes properly? Moreover, how can they be ſayd to be appointed to Dioceſan Churches ſuch as ours (for to ſpeak of other Dioceſes, that are eſtranged from Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, is to rove farre wide from the queſtion) who are appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto cities and countries, (not to feed and govern them, as all Churches are by their Paſtors; but) to labour their converſion that yet remayned Pagans and Infidels? To provoke him therefore in his next defence, to undertake the proofe of this propoſition which he now taketh for graunted, I firſt contradict it thus; <hi>They who were appointed to whole cities and countries, for the working out of the converſion, were not ſet over Dioceſan Churches ſuch as ours:</hi> Then I take his owne aſſumption, with the help thereof to conclude; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictorie of his former propoſition, in this manner. <hi>The Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries ordeyned by the Apoſtles were appointed to whole cities and countries, for the working out of their converſion. Therefore, the Preſbyteries ordeyned by the Apostles, were not ſet over Dioceſan Churches, ſuch as ours.</hi> This our propoſition oppoſed againſt his, may be fortified by this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thymeme. <hi>Thoſe whole cities and countries whoſe people are generally ſo

Therefore, neyther they, who were appointed over ſuch cities and countries, ſet over dioceſan Churches ſuch as ours.</hi> The Antecedent is a truth ſo apparant to all the world, that it were madnes to contradict it: And the conſequence is ſuch as (I verify think) no man of comon ſenſe, will ever call it into queſtion. As for the Refuters exceptions againſt the propoſition which he had framed for an other purpoſe; they are (as the Doctor ſaith) <hi>eavils not worth the refuting;</hi> and yet (to ſhewe his valour) he will needes have a fling at them, though with ſhame to himſelfe. For firſt, for want of juſt matter of blame, he forgeth a falſe calumniation in in ſaying, <hi>That, his Refuter abſurdly eavilleth with him, as if he had ſayd that, all in the citie and country were in S. Iohns time converted.</hi> For the fumme of the firſt exception is nothing but this, <hi>that the Apoſtles ordeyned Preſeyters for ſuch an end (as he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth) yet it followeth not that the Churches were great cities &amp; the countries adioyning.</hi> And he backeth it with this reaſon, <hi>that, the ſeed of the word in many places was thick ſowne, but came thin up, and the heat of perſeeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at, that, time, burnt up the zoale and profeſſion of many.</hi> Which if it were too weak to juſtify the exception, why doth he not take notice of confute it? thinketh he, his unpartiall readers will take it for a ſufficient refutation, to ſay, <hi>it is a cavill not worth the refuting?</hi> The ſecond exception is of more moment; becauſe it ſerveth alſo to weaken the propoſition of the Doctors owne argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before ſet downe. For the ordeyning of Presbyters for whole cities and countries, to labour the converſion of all that in thoſe places belonged to God; can never prove that they were appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the care and charge of dioceſan Churches; unleſſe there be a neceſſitie that all which in time were to be converted by their Miniſterie, ſhould be and remaine members of the ſame Church with them. It ſhall not be amiſle therefore to ſtay a while upon the examination of that which the Refuter hath ſayd, to juſtifie his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall; and the Doct. to mainteyn the affirmation, of this neceſſitie. <note place="margin">Sect. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>In defenſe of the negative, it was alleadged (anſw. pag. 57) that it is very likely if not certeyne, that they of Cenchrea received the goſpell from Corinthe; (for Cenchtea was the port of Corinthe, and not farre from it, as Radcliffe or Lymehouſe to London) yet was it a diſtinct Church from that of Corinth; for it is called the Church of Cenchrea. Rom. 16. 1. The Doctor in his reply, firſt
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:14068:172"/> layeth downe his own opinion touching this matter, and then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoreth to wreſt that example of the Church of Cenchraea, out of his refuters handes.

But how long? and how? was it for a perpetuitie, or for a time onely, till they might be furniſhed with their proper Miniſtery? And when the faith ſpread it ſelf from any of thoſe cheife cities which firſt enterteyned it; into the townes adjoyning (&amp; that with ſuch increaſe that the number of beleevers in thoſe places, were ſufficient to make two or moe Churches or congregations) did they all remaine ſtill parts of one Church; and was it eſteemed by ſuch as effected their aſſemblies? Here lieth the pith and marrow of the preſent controverſie; wherefore if the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor doth reſolutely hold the affirmative, he ſhould haue plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contradicted the refuter, and ſayd, there was a neceſſitie, that all which were brought to the faith, in any city and country adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by the labours of any appointed for their converſion, ſhould remayn (though never ſo many or farre diſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t) me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of the citie-Church, which firſt enterteyned the goſpell. Perhaps he thought his readers would expect ſome better proofe then his bare word, <hi>I ſay it,</hi> to conclude this neceſſitie. And it was not eaſy for him to yeeld any ſound reaſon, for the juſtifying of ſuch an aſſertion; in wiſdome therefore he judged it better, to ſay and affirme that which (though it beleffe pertinent, yet) might ſeeme more reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable (viz. that ſuch as were converted by their labours, that were appointed to indeavor their converſion, ſhould ſubmit themſelves
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:14068:172"/> to be governed by them) and in ſtead of yeilding any pregnant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration to confute his Refuters exception, to make a ſhewe of removing that which was alleadged by him. To this purpoſe he addeth; <hi>that though Cenchrea be called a Church, yet was it not ſuch a Church as we now speak of, indued with power of eccleſiasticall government, but ſubiect to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Rom. 16. 1. 1. Cor. 1. 2.) will argue our aſſertion to be more probable, (when we ſay, they were diſtinct Churches, &amp; alike indued with power of eccleſiaſticall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment) then his denyall that hath no other confirmation then <hi>I ſay it,</hi> or <hi>ſo it was;</hi> for what authoritie hath he, eyther to ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate one to another, or to confine in one eccleſiaſticall body, those ſocieties which Gods word maketh diſtinct Churches?</p>

Nay, why doth himſelfe combine them in one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexive propoſition in this manner? pag 66: <hi>If the Apoſtles intending the converſion of the nation, as they began themſelves to preach in the cheife cities, ſo they placed Preſbyters to the ſame intent; hoping by them to convert, both citie and countrie; then were they appointed and it was their dutie, to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour the converſion of all belonging to God both in citie and countrie.</hi> For if the aſſumption be added to this propoſition, is it not as large as that which his Refuter framed and divided into 3. parts, (viz. 1. that the Apoſtles intending to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>vert any natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, firſt preached the Goſpell in the cheife cities thereof. 2. and having converted ſome
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:14068:173"/> there uſually ordeyned Presbyters. 3. by their Miniſtery to convert the reſt of the citie &amp; countrie. Why then ſhould he not take home to himſelfe thoſe words of his, wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> cannot he bring within the compaſs of his ſyllogiſmes? 2. Moreover, ſince he ſaith, that the laſt of the 3. parts diſtinguiſhed by his Refuter; is the aſſumption it ſelf, and inferred on the two former; as he ſetteth them downe; doth he not confound the aſſumption, with one (at leaſt if not with both) of the arguments which ſhould confirme it? for if a man ſhould ſay, that the D. preached his ſermon, to enlarge his favour with his good Lord, the Biſhop of B. and W. &amp; the reſt of the Prelates; who would not vnderſtand ſuch a ſpeach to carrie this meaning, that the very end whereat he aymed in his preaching, was the enlarging of his favour &amp;c. And that an hope to gaine more grace with them moved him to vndertake the work? If then himſelf, or any friend of his ſhould deny and contradict this ſpeach; would he not take him for a trifler, (or rather a ſlanderer) that ſhould make his boaſt, he could prove it with. 2. arguments, and yet had nothing elſe to ſay, then in a change of phraſe, to repeat the ſame thing in this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: The inlarging of his favour with his good Lord the Biſhop &amp;c was the very end which he propoſed to himſelf when he preached. And he hoped by this meanes to gaine more grace. Therefore (doubtleſs) he preached this ſermon to enlarge his favour &amp;c. Yet ſuch (and no better) are the Doct. arguments, when he proveth that the Presbyteries were planted by the Apoſtles in Cities, to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour the converſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the cities and countries adjoyning; becauſe their converſion was both the end intended by the Apoſtles; &amp; the thing they hoped by their labour to effect.</p>
                     <p>3. But perhaps, there may be found (upon due examination) ſome greater light, or help for the clearing of the aſſumption in queſtion, then can at the firſt bluſh be diſcerned in the arguments: as they are layd downe. It ſhall not therefore be amiſſe to compare them a part, with the point wherevnto they are referred, and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void blame (if it be poſible) I will ſtick cloſe to the words of his owne connexive propoſition before delivered; &amp; derive fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence, the Antecedent of each Enthymeme. Firſt then (from the end in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the Apoſtles) he argueth thus. The Apoſtles intending the converſion of any nation, as they began themſelves to preach in the cheife Cities; ſo they placed Presbyters to the ſame intent. Ergo, thoſe Presbyters (or Presbyteries) were appointed to labour
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:14068:173"/> the converſion of all that belonged to God both in citie &amp; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie. The pith of the argument, lieth in the later braunch of the antecedent. viz. the Apoſtles placed Presbyters in the cheife Cities, for the converſion of the whole nation. And it ſeemeth to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifyed in this manner. The Apoſtles placed Presbyters to the ſame intent, for which themſelves preached in the cheife cities. But they preached there with an intent to convert the whole nation. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they alſo placed Presbyters in the Cheife Cities for the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the whole nation.</p>
                     <p>To begin with the concluſion which is the Antecedent of the D. firſt argument, if there were an evident truth in it, it would ſerve (if need were) to contradict, the antecedent of the maine argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t (propounded ſect. 4) in this ſort; The Presbyters (or Presbyteries) ordeyned by the Apoſtles, were placed in cheife cities for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the whole nation. Ergo they were appointed for whole provinces or rather nations and not for dioceſes properly. The ſame will be concluded much more fully, from the propoſition of the laſt ſyllogiſme, and the inſtances that he giveth (pag 66) to prove the aſſumption thereof. (For if) Th' Apoſtles placed Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in cheife Cities, to the ſame intent, for which themſelves began to preach there: (If alſo) Pauls intent in preaching and ſtaying at Corinth an whole yeare and 6 monthes, and 3. yeares at Epheſus, was to convert, (not the dioceſe of Corinth or Epheſus onely, but) the whole nation of Aſia, and Achaia (Then it will follow that) <hi>Paul</hi> in placing Presbyters at Corinth and Epheſus (did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the dioceſe of Corinth or Epheſus, but for the whole country of Achaia and Aſia; to labour as farre as they were able, the converſion of all that belonged to God in thoſe parts.</p>
                     <p>To the like purpoſe, his 2. argument tendeth, when (from the Apoſtles hope) he reaſoneth thus. The Apoſtles hoped by thoſe Presbyters which they placed in cheife Cities, to convert both citie and country, (And this their hope was grounded on the force of the goſpell teſtifyed by our Saviour, Math. 13. 53.) Ergo, thoſe Presbyters were appointed (and it was their dutie) to labour the converſion of all, that in citie and countrie belonged to God. For vnleſſe their hope, (the motive that guided their intention) ſhould be abſurdly reſtreined into a farr narrower compaſſe, then the end which they intended: the countrie whoſe converſion he incloſeth within their hope, and ſo allotteth to the charge of the Presbyters,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:14068:174"/> as the lump that was to be leavened by their Miniſtery, muſt be the whole nation and not ſo ſmall a portion as one Dioceſe. But as I purpoſe not to dwell vpon this advantage; ſo I need not uſe many words to remove the ground of both his arguments, ſince they have no other foundation, then his owne wavering fancie, which doth not well accord with itſelf. It is time I ſhould compare the Refuters anſwer &amp; his defence togither, to ſee whether his ſecond thoughts have any more weight of reaſon in them then the firſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It can never be ſhewed</hi> (ſayth the Refut: anſw. pag. 57.) neyther may it be reaſonably thought that it was any part, of thoſe Preſbyters proper <note place="margin">Sect. 7. ad p. 66</note> 
                        <hi>duty, to labour the converſion of the reſidue, eyther in citie or countrey. For howſoever we deny not, but that it belonged to them, both as Chriſtians to uſe all opportunity of winning to the faith; &amp; as Miniſters to preach to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo, if they were preſent in their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: yet it was their office to attend on the flock, whereof the holy Ghoſt had made them overſeers, Act. 20. 28. And not like Apostles or Evangeliſts to imploy themſelves in the converſion of them that were no Christians. By theſe fewe words</hi> (ſaith the Doctor) <hi>the deep wiſdome of the pariſh diſciplinarians, may eaſily be ſounded. 1. they conceive that Churches in the first constitution of them, when there were but a fewe converted, and before pariſhes were diſtinguiſhed, were in the ſame e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, that now they are being fully constituted &amp;c. 2. that the flock over which the Preſbyters were ſet, was onely that number of Christians already converted &amp;c. 3. that their proper office was to attend them onely which were already converted; and not to labour the converſion of the reſt, &amp;c.</hi> The laſt of theſe I confeſſe is plainly averred by the Refuter, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond by conſequence implyed. But the firſt hath no ſhadowe of any foundation in his words; ſo that the Doctor his deep wiſdome hath drawne it (I ſuppoſe) out of his owne drowſy imagination. And yet if it be an erronious conceit, why bendeth he not the ſtroak of ſome one reaſon or other againſt it? Yea how will the D. free himſelf from error; ſeing the refuter hath nothing in his whole anſwer, that doth more ſavour of that conceit, then theſe words of the Doct. (Def. pag. 54.) that the circuite of the Church was the ſame, when there were fewe, and when there were many, yea when all were Chriſtians) and thoſe in his ſermon pag 25. that vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the diviſion of pariſhes, there happened no alteratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the ſtate of the Biſhop.</p>
                     <p>2. Moreover, if the ſecond be an errour, whoſe hand is deepeſt in it? whether the Refuter who alleadgeth Act. 20. 28. to ſhew
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:14068:174"/> that the office of Presbyters was to attend that flock, whereof the H. Ghoſt had made them overſeers; or the Doctor who cite<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>h the ſame ſcripture (ſerm. pag. 18.) to juſtify this ſpeach, that the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters were to attend the flock converted, feeding them with the word &amp; ſacraments. Very likely then, he ſuppoſed it to be a truth, <note place="margin">A contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in the Doct.</note> that the flock over which they were ſet, was onely that number of Chriſtians; which were already converted. And he had good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſo to judge, becauſe that flock onely was the viſible Church, which then profeſſed the faith of Chriſt at Epheſus. But now he ſeeth it is an error ſo to conceive; <hi>becauſe our Saviour calle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                     <p>3. As touching the third point, the Refuter hath plainely diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered his judgment, how farre he granteth it, and in what reſpect he denieth it, to be the dutie of Presbyters, to labour the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Infidels. For beſides the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon dutie of Chriſtians, to uſe all opportunity for the winning of them to the faith, they are (as he faith) to preach vnto them, if they will come into their aſſemblies; but to imploy their labour in traveiling to and fro in any countrie or dioceſe, to preach vnto them, where they find any concourſe of people: this he denyeth to be any part of the Presbyteriall functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and judgeth it rather to be the work of an Apoſtle, or Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt. Which plaine dealing of the Refuter requireth in equity the like at the hands of the Doctor, by ſhewing how, &amp; in what courſe holdeth it their dutie, to labour the converſion of infidels; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the like traveil and imployment, that the Apoſtles &amp; Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, vndertooke in places where the goſpell had not yet any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, or whether in any other faſhion, that the Ref: apprehended not? But he (I will not ſay craftily) concealeth from his Reader, the parts of his Refuters diſtinction; and (as if he had ſimply de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed them, any way to labour the converſion, of any that were all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enated from the faith) he reſteth on this trifling replie, <hi>as though,</hi>
                        <pb n="28" facs="tcp:14068:175"/> ſaith he, <hi>the Apoſtles intended by their Miniſtery the converſion: and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of no more, but thoſe few that were at first converted.</hi> And then for the <hi>better manifestation of their wiſdome</hi> (he ſhould have ſayd of his owne inhability to make good his aſſertion) he <hi>oppoſeth them with a fewe queſtions,</hi> which yet are more then needed; but let us heare them; &amp; they are theſe;</p>
                     <p>1. Whether the <hi>Preſbyters ordeyned by the Apoſtles were not Miniſters of the</hi> word? 2. whether they were <hi>not many, in ſome places more, in ſome fiwer; yea ſometimes as many as thoſe who were before converted?</hi> Act. 19. 6. 3. whether, <hi>they being many, were onely to attend that</hi> ſmal number of converts? 4. whether the Apoſtles in <hi>ordeyning many, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended not the converſion of more then thoſe few?</hi> 5. whether it <hi>was not their office, to labour their converſion?</hi> 6. If not, <hi>how they were</hi> to be convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? 7. Nay, <hi>if they did not labour, how were they converted?</hi> Of theſe 7. the. 3. 4. and 5. might have been ſpared, ſeing they are already anſwered. viz. that the converſion of citie &amp; countrie did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to their office, as any proper work thereof (and therefore was not intended by the Apoſtles in ordeyning them) otherwiſe then is before expreſſed. The reſt alſo might have been overpaſſed (ſince he knoweth his Refuters mind therein) ſave that he would cloſely intimate vnto his Reader (as it ſeemeth) two arguments to juſtify his owne aſſertion; for the anſwer which himſelf hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the 2. firſt may argue for his purpoſe in this manner, The Presbyters ordeyned by the Apoſtles were all Miniſters of the word, and were many in each Church, yea in ſome places as many, as thoſe that were beſides converted: wherefore it is probable that the Apoſtles intended by their Miniſterie, to convert the reſt, and that it was a duty proper to their office, to labour their converſio. How true it is, which in the firſt place he avoucheth, I will not here debate; it belongeth to another treatiſe; the later part of his Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent importeth that the Apoſtles ordeyned many Miniſters for each Church, though the number of converts were ſo ſmall, that in ſome places it ſcarce exceeded the number of Presbyters. A mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo unlikely, that if the conſequent annexed, muſt hang in ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, till he hath made good proofe of this aſſertion; I ſeare it will wearie the deareſt of his friends, to wait for the proof thereof. All that he hath yet found worth the mencioning, is that the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt reporteth, Act. 19. 6. 7. viz. that Paul having found at Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus certeine Diſciples (about 12. in number, that had been parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:14068:175"/> of Iohns Baptiſme) by impoſing hands on them, gave them the guifts of the Holy Ghoſt, ſo that they ſpake with tongues and propheſied. From hence he gathereth, 1. that theſe perſons were at that time, enabled by the giftes of the ſpirit, for the worke of the Miniſterie. 2. Yea ordeyned Presbyters &amp; appointed to take the charge of that Church. 3. That they did equall the number of all that were beſides converted. 4. And conſequently that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in Churches newly conſtituted, the number of people con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted was not much greater then the number of Presbyters pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced among them; for this he affirmed once before. Cap. 1. pag. 6. The firſt of theſe may be doubted of, we conſider how gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the gifts of the holy Ghoſt, were at other times beſlowed, Act. 8. 12-17. &amp; 10. 44. 46. But I will not contend about this point. The ſecond is more unlikely then the firſt, and the third more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd then the ſecond, and therefore the laſt which floweth from theſe, hath nothing to releive it; for as there is not a ſyllable in the text, to uphold eyther the one or the other; ſo it ſuteth not with the Apoſtles wiſdome, ſo farre to exceed here the proportio which he held in other places, betweene the number of the Presbyters, and the ſtate of the Churches, to which they were aſſigned (as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf confeſſeth in this 67. page lin. 10.) 2. Moreover it was the uſuall courſe of the Apoſtles in all places where they came, to plant the goſpell, firſt to continue their own preaching, for the gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a competent number to the faith, &amp; then to give them Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, to feed thoſe whom they had converted; (as the Doctor alſo acknowledgeth in the firſt of his two arguments, pag. 65.) It were abſurd therefore to imagine, that he ſhould now take a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous and contrarie order; at his firſt coming to Epheſus to ordeyne them 12. Miniſters, and himſelfe to ſtay there 3. yeares af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to labour their converſion, by his owne preaching. 3. Again, we may truely ſay of preaching Presbyters, that which he ſaith of Biſhops (ſerm. pag. 65.) there was not that uſe of them, among a people which was to be converted, before they needed to be fedd, and governed; eſpecially while the Apoſtles was preſent, and had the aſſiſtance of Evangeliſts to labour their converſion with him. Act. 19. 22. 4. Were the Refuter as full of queſtions as the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, he might ask him, how 12. Presbyters could have that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable ſtipend, which in juſtice is due to the for their work fake (as himſelf underſtandeth the Apoſtle. 1. Tim. 5. 17. ſee lib. 1. p.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:14068:176"/> 127.) if the number of converts that were bound to mainteyn the, were but ſo many perſons, or thereabouts? 5. And if he ſhall ask, to what uſe, their guift of propheſy was imployed, if they were not Presbyters affixed to the care of that flock? he may take anſwer from theſe ſcriptures, Act. 2. 17. &amp; 11. 27. &amp; 13. 1. &amp; 15, 31. &amp; 1. Cor. 14 29. 31. &amp; 1. Tim, 4. 14. which ſhewe that all prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſying was not incloſed within th breiſt of his preaching presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. But I have ſayd enough to ſhewe, that we deny not without cauſe out aſſent to his idle fancie of a number of Presbyters given to ſome Churches, by farre too many for the number of perſons already converted. Wherefore till he hath yeelded better proofes for this ſuppoſall, it cannot conclude his purpoſe. viz. that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles intended the converſion of citie and countrey adjoyning, by the Miniſterie of thoſe Presbyters, which he ordeyned in any citie that had enterteyned the faith.</p>
                     <p>The 2. laſt queſtions before delivered, intimate this opinion ſelted in the Doctor; that <hi>if the Preſoyters ordeyned in cities by the <note place="margin">Sect. 9.</note> Apoſtles, were not appointed to labour the converſion of the reſt (yea if they did not indeavor it) then there was no meanes to effect their coverſion.</hi> (Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to if the Aſſumption be addeth) But there was a meanes appointed for their converſion; and it was in time effected. (Then this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion will follow) Therefore they were appointed to labour their converſion; and (as their office did binde them, ſo) they did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor it. But the propoſition is falſe, and diſcovereth an high preſumption in the Doctor, that dareth limit the wiſdome &amp; work of God, unto one onely meanes &amp; that ſuch as he fancieth to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, without any warrant, (yea againſt the clear light) of the word. For was not the converſion of Infidels unto the faith, the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall work of the extraordinarie function of Apoſtles, and of Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, that accompanied and aſſiſted them in their traveiles? 2. And when the Apoſtles themſelves left any Churches to the care of Presbyters ordeyned by them; did they not uſe the labour of their fellowe helpers, to finiſh the work which they had begun? 3. And why doth Mr Doctor take no notice of the meanes menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by the Refuter, to wit; the private labours both of the preſ-byters, &amp; of every well affected Chriſtian ſtriving to winne others unto the faith; and the publick exhortations and inſtructions, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by the Miniſters to thoſe heathen, that had acceſſe to the church-aſſemblies ſeing the ſcripture acknowledgeth that even by
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:14068:176"/> theſe helps, the work of the Lord in the gathering togither of his Saincts hath bene very much furthered? Rom. 16. 3. 12. Phil. 2. 15. 16. &amp; 4. 3. Iam. 5. 19. 20. 1. Cor. 14. 24. 25. 4. But though the Doctor make light account of theſe helps; yet the Apoſtles were not ignorant, that his hand was not ſhortned, who had given them good (as of his bleſſing upon ſuch weak meanes, ſo alſo) of his working out the calling and ſalvation of ſuch as belonged to his kingdome, by many other wayes. Act. 8. 4. 5. 26. 40. &amp; 9. 38. &amp; 10. 3. 5. &amp; 11. 19. 21. Iſa. 2. 3. Zach. 8. 23. Ioh. 1. 41. 45. &amp; 4. 29. 39. &amp; 12. 20. 21. Apoc. 3. 9. And therefore we have no cauſe to think, that any feare of wanting fit meanes for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of Gods elect, that yet were drowned in paganiſme, ſhould carrie them, to comit this work, vnto thoſe Presbyters whom they ordeyned for the feeding of the flock already converted.</p>
                     <p>So much to the 7. queſtions, there remayneth 3. more to make <note place="margin">Sect. 10. ad pag. 67. 68.</note> up the compleat number of 10; which (though they be nothing to the preſent buſynes, yet) may not be overpaſſed, leaſt he crow over his Refuter without cauſe. <hi>Were all theſe Preſbyters</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Paſtors property of that one flock; or was there but one properly the Paſtor or Biſhop, the reſt being his Aſſiſtants? 2. when more were converted, then could well aſſemble in one ordinarie congregation were not the congregation divided?</hi> 3. vpon this diviſion, was <hi>there a Biſhop and Preſbyterie aſſigned to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry congregation; or onely one Preſbyter &amp;c.</hi> Becauſe theſe queſtions are fitted (as alſo the former were) not ſo much to be informed what we hold, as to ſhewe what himſelfe would have to be imbraced; let us firſt conſider, to what iſſue he driveth the matter, which is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in the words following, pag 68, where he ſaith; <hi>That the pariſh diſciplinarisns doe ſhew themſelves to be of ſhallow judgement, &amp; their pariſh diſcipline to conſiſt of undiſgeſted favcies,</hi> in that they imagin the ſtate of the Churches and charge of the Miniſters, was ſo the ſame, before the diviſion of pariſhes and after; that now every congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall have her Biſhop and Presbyterie, like as that one Church had, before Pariſhes were divided in the Dioceſe; and that as now Miniſters are appointed to atted their ſeverall Charges; ſo alſo then it was the proper office of the Biſhop and his Presbyterie to attend the flock already converted. No merveile if the Doctors ſtomach, which afficteth nothing but that which favoureth the Dioceſa diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline cannot digeſt theſe points; yet will it be hard for him, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the reſolution of his queſtions, to gather any well digeſted argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:14068:177"/> to prove them vndigeſted ſancies. In the two former; he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumeth (as it ſeemeth) vpon an agreement with his Refuter in theſe two points, viz. that of thoſe many presbyters, which the Apoſtles ordeyned in any one Citie; one onely was properly the Paſtor or Biſhop, and the reſt his Aſſiſtants. And 2. that when more were converted then could well aſſemble togither in one ordinary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, the congregations were divided. But in the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ſt of theſe, he groſſely forgetteth himſelfe. For how could one of thoſe preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters be a Biſhop, if that be true, which he peremptorily holdeth, (ſerm. pag. 69. def. lib. 4. pag. 63.) viz. that the presbyters firſt ordeyned by the Apoſtles, to labour the converſion of the people, had not any Biſhop among them. Moreover in denying the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters which aſſiſted the Biſhop, to be properly Paſtors of that flock which they fedd in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon; doth he not at vnawares weaken one of his beſt arguments, framed by him againſt Lay-Elders? lib. 1. pag. III. for the governing Elders in the church of Geneva, are Paſtors improperly, (as Beza ſheweth de grad: Miniſt. cap. 9.) If therefore the Presbyters of Epheſus (&amp; conſequently the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters mencioned. 1. Tim. 5. 17, being the ſame with thoſe of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus, Act. 20. 28. as he profeſſeth, lib. 1. pag. 108; If I ſay theſe Presbyters) were none otherwiſe Paſtors then improperly; why might they not be Lay-Elders? or how could they be properly Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the word (as he mainteyneth) if they were not properly Paſtors? In the anſwer, which himſelfe maketh to the laſt of his queſtions; lieth the weight of all that yeildeth him any advantage. And ſince it inquireth altogither <hi>de ſacto</hi> (what was done) and not <hi>de jure,</hi> (what in right ought to be done) vnleſſe he had kept him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe within the times of the Apoſtles, and grounded his aſſumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> upon ſuch records, as may aſſure us of their approbation, he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth overweakely to conclude as he doth. 1. that our pariſh aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies at this day, ought to have one onely Presbyter, (and not a Presbyterie to aſſiſt their Paſtor) becauſe ſuch an order was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, for thoſe Churches which were multiplied, upon an increaſe of converts in cities and villages adjoyning. 2. that the firſt Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters were not (as Miniſters now are) ſet over the flock converted onely, but over the whole citie and countrie to labour their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, becauſe upon the diviſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregations in the dioceſe when each congregation had her Presbyter to attend it; the Biſhop of the citie and his Presbyterie had a generall ſuperintendencie over all,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:14068:177"/> not onely to govern them, and their Presbyters; but alſo to labour the converſion of the reſt. And doth not himſelfe weaken the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of his owne reaſoning? when he telleth us (lib. 3. cap. 1. ſect. 9.) that the Churches of former times (before Conſtantines daies) were not in all things eſtablished and ſetled according to their deſires; <hi>for in time of perſecution their government was not alwaies ſuch as they would, but ſuch as they could attaine vnto.</hi> But how proveth he, that which he aſſumeth for a truth not to be contradicted? viz. 1. that upon the firſt diviſion of congregations, the ancient Mother-Church onely, had her presbyterie to aſſiſt the Biſhop, the reſt of the Churches having each of them one onely Presbyter: and 2. that the Biſhops Presbyterie in office and charge differed from the reſt of the Presbyters in this; that the presbyters were reſtreyned to the feeding of their particular Churches; &amp; the Presbytery aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted the Biſhop; in procuring the converſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſuch as yet remained in infidelity.</p>
                     <p>It is a knowne truth confeſſed by the Doctor, that when chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches <note place="margin">Sect. 11.</note> were multiplied in Aſia, after S. Paul had preached &amp; placed Presbyters at Epheſus (and that with an intent as he conceiveth to work out the converſion oſ all Aſia, by the labour of thoſe Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters) each Church was made equall with the Mother-Church of Epheſus, in this, that as ſhe, ſo they had, (not one onely presbyter, but) a presbyterie togither with a Biſhop; or Preſident to governe them. For he teacheth out of his text (Apoc. 1. 20.) that the 7 churches of Aſia, had each of them her Presbyterie and a Biſhop entitled by the name of an Angell: moreover, he acknowledgeth (Def. chap. 7. pag. 23.) that Timothy and Titus (who were as he faith Biſhops, the one of all Aſia, the other of all the Churches in Creete) were to ordeyne Presbyters in the ſeverall cities; and that by Pauls direction, aſwell by letter as example; and addeth, that he no where readeth, that they aſſigned ſeverall Presbyters to their ſeverall Cures, e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>yther in citie or countrie. So then it is cleare by the Doctors own confeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that how many Churches ſo ever were multiplied within the epiſcopall charge of Timothy &amp; Titus, they all had (&amp; by Pauls direction ought to haue) a presbyterie, and not a ſingle presbyter in any place to attend them. Wherefore for the better manifeſtation (I ſay not of the Doctors wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:14068:178"/> his reſolution in theſe ſewe quaeſtions. Were not the Epiſtles to Timothy and Titus written to informe all Biſhops (even Dioceſan Biſhops if there were any ſuch ordeyned by the Apoſtles) and their ſucceſſors unto the worlds end; how to exerciſe their function, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well in reſpect of ordination, as of juriſdiction? ſee this maintey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, lib. 4. Def. pag. 75. 83. &amp; 85: if then theſe epiſtles gave the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no direction for the placing of a ſingular Presbyter, but rather for the ordeyning of a (Presbyterie, or) company of Presbyters, for thoſe Churches, that were (or ſhould be) multiplied in their charge: doth it not follow that every dioceſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Biſhop, ought to have a Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterie, (&amp; not one Presbyter onely) to every Church that ſhould grow up in his Dioceſe? If he ſhall ſay that the Apoſtles charge of ordeyning many Presbyters for one Church, was limited to ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, is it not in effect to deny, that the Apoſtle gave them, any dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for dioceſan Biſhops; how to furniſh the Churches of their dioceſe? But was the Apoſtles care onely for cities, and not for country-townes? Or did he appoint the Biſhop, and Presbyters of cities to labour the converſion of the townes and villages, and yet give them no inſtruſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> how to ſettle a Miniſterie amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g them? muſt dioceſan Biſhops fetch their patterne, for the right way of eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing particular Churches within their Dioceſe, from Damaſus his pontificall, and the practiſe of Euariſtus and Dyoniſius, that were Biſhops of Rome, and not from the writings of the Apoſtles?

That each title had one onely Presbyter and no more aſſigned to it. 3. that thoſe Presbyters were (as he ſaith, ſerm. pag. 46. &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

That beſides thoſe presbyters ſo diſtributed to their cures, there were others which remayned with the Biſhop, as aſſiſtants unto him in the Mother-church. Till theſe particulars be ſupported with better proofes, then yet the Doctor hath produced; I doubt not but the diſcreete reader will ſee, he was ledd by prejudice rather then by any ſound reaſon, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he pronounced it an undiſgeſted ſancie, to affirme, that as every particular Church in the Apoſtles times had; ſo now it ought to have a presbyterie to governe it.</p>
                     <p>But, ſay he could prove by invincible arguments, that the <note place="margin">Sect. 12.</note> pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh-aſſemblies
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:14068:178"/> which are multiplied in every Dioceſe, ought to have one onely presbyter, and not a presbyterie, as the firſt chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches had, which were planted in cities by the Apoſtles; how will he ever be able to make good, that difference which he putteth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the presbyters of pariſh Churches, and the presbyterie of the Mother-church, when he giveth to the later, and denieth to the former, the dutie of labouring the converſion of all, that ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in citie or country, remaine eſtranged from the faith? It is before obſerved that in his conceit, the presbyters of Epheſus were placed by S. Paul to indeavor the converſion of all Aſia, as farre as they were able: and yet nevertheleſſe, he giveth to the ſeverall preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries of other cities, as Smyrna, Pergamus, Thyatira &amp;c. the charge of converting all within their Dioceſe. Now if the generall charge of the whole nations converſion, firſt caſt upon the presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie of one cheife citie, be no barre againſt the presbyters of other cities, to deny them the like charge, for the reſt of each citie and country adjoyning, why ſhould the Dioceſan charge of any preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterie, in any one citie, debarre the presbyters eſtabliſhed in cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey townes, that imbrace the goſpell before ſome others, from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoring the converſion of the reſt in the ſame towne, and the hamlett adjoyning? If he have any teſtimonie (divine or humane, ancient or moderne) to juſtify this difference, why doth he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe them in ſilence? If he have none, is it not as indiſgeſted a fancie, as ever was broached by a man of learning? And to come to our owne times, ſince there is in many Dioceſes, great ſcarcity of able Teachers, and the Doctor is perſwaded that without the word preached, men ordinarily cannot atteyne to ſalvation; no nor yet to any degree thereof in this life (viz. neyther to an effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all vocation, nor to juſtification, or ſanctification, as he teacheth elſewhere. (ſerm. of the dignitie and ductie of the Miniſters, pag. 27.) I would faine knowe who there are that ſtand charged, by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and dutie to labour the vocation of ſuch, as have not any able preacher ſet over them? Whether the Biſhop and his presbyterie; or the preachers that are licenſed for the Dioceſe, or the Idol-mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters onely, that have charge of ſoules in thoſe places co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to them? For why ſhould not the Biſhop &amp; Presbyterie ſtand char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, with the office and duetie of labouring their vocation at this day; if it did of old belong to their office, to work out the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of ſuch as remayned in unbeleefe? and yet why ſhould they
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:14068:179"/> beare the burthen of this work, ſince there are many other preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, authorized for the Dioceſe; and the Idol-miniſters are by their inſtitution to their beneſices as deeply charged, with the care of ſouls in their places, as any of the moſtable preachers? Againe, if all licenced preachers ought in dutie to lend their help for this work; how ſhall this dutie (of labouring to reduce vnbeleevers to the ſaith) diſtinguiſh the office of the ancient Presbyters, firſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned by the Apoſtles, from the function &amp; charge of Miniſters, which now are allotted to their ſeverall Cures? but if the cure of ſouls: which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to ſuch Idols, doe diſcharge all others fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bond of this dutie, how ſhall the people vnder their charge be brought vnto ſalvation? It co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to my remembrance at length, that the Doctor ſaith, our divines in the vniverſities, are ordeyned (as the firſt Presbyters were) to the nationall Church in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon; before they be aſſigned to their peculiar titles or cures (ſerm. pag. 50. in the Margin) ſhall the burthen of this work relie on their ſhoulders? I hope that in his next defenſe, he will clearely reſolve us of theſe doubtes; meane while, he muſt give both Refuter and Reader (I think) leave to think, that the office and charge of our Miniſters now affixed to their cures, is altogither the ſame, with the charge of thoſe preaching Elders, which were planted in the firſt Apoſtolical Churches, to feed the ſlock that dependeth on the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? (Acts 20. 28. 1. pet. 5. 2.) &amp; that the converſion of Inſidels then, was none otherwiſe a work of the office of thoſe Presbyters, then it is the dutie of our Miniſters now, to labour the vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of thoſe, which in pariſhes adjoyning to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doe want the ordinarie meanes of their ſalvation. The propoſition therefore, and the aſſumption of his firſt argument (before propounded ſect. 4.) being found weak, and deſtitute of any ſtay, ſufficient to uphold them, we are now to ſee; if his ſecond argument, be of any more worth to inferre that concluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which he indeavoureth to juſtify. viz. that the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries ordeyned by the Apoſtles, were appointed not to pariſhes, but to Dioceſes.</p>

                     <p>His ſecond argument, Mr Doctor himſelf hath thus framed, <hi>When the Churches were not diuided into ſeveral Pariſhes, nor Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters

                     </p>

                        <hi>In the Apoſtles times the Churches were not diuided into ſeverall Pariſhes &amp;c. Ergo in the Apostles times the Preſbyteries were not appointed to Pariſhes but to Dioceſes.</hi> We ſee here, how he hath himſelf framed it, now he telleth us how his Refuter, <hi>after his perpetuall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> propounded the propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> connexively thus, <hi>Iſ the pariſhes were not distinguiſhed in the Apoſtles times, nor the Preſbyters aſſigned to their ſeuerall titles or cures; but in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon were to attend the whole flock conuerted, or to labour the conuerſion of the reſidue: then the Preſbyters in the Apostles times were not appointed for pariſhes but for dioceſes.</hi> Was it a fault in the Refuter (trow ye) to propound the propoſition connexively with aſtrict eye to the words of his ſermon? and is it praiſeworthy in the Doctor to exchange it for an other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nexive propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he alſo made a change of one phraſe, for his advantage; for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <note place="margin">The Doct. changeth a phraſe for advantage.</note> at the firſt ſayd that in the Apoſtles times, <hi>Pariſhes were not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed,</hi> now he ſaith, <hi>the Churches in their times were not diuided into ſeuerall pariſhes;</hi> which later may be true, and yet the former falſe, as we ſhall ſee anon, when we come to his aſſumption.

Firſt he asketh how the Presbyters could be aſſigned to ſeverall Pariſhes when there were no pariſhes diſtinguiſhed? And 2. if they were appointed to labour the converſion of all that belonged to God, in the citie and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, how were they not appointed to dioceſes? Behold here, how the Doctor is driven to diſioynt his propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, (like as he doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo pag. 70. lin. 2. &amp; 6.) and to prove the part thereof a part. Why then doth he count his Refuter (Def. lib. 1. pag. 148.) to be no better then a groſſe headed Sophiſter for the like courſe? and why then did he not divide it at the firſt into 2. members, the one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding that the presbyters were not appointed to pariſhes; &amp; the other, that they were appointed unto dioceſes? But (once againe to return him his owne) what cannot he bring within the compaſſe of one of his ſyllogiſmes? Now to anſwer his queſtions; touching the firſt, be it freely confeſſed, that when Pariſhes were not at all diſtinguiſhed, Presbyters could not be aſſigned to ſeveral Pariſhes. But if the Doctor had not departed from the words of his propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition (whether craftily or careleſly, I leave it to his owne conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) I would flatly have refuſed to aſſent to his connexion: for the Presbyters ordeyned by the Apoſtles might be aſſigned unto pariſhes; (that is to ſay, the Churches unto which the Presbyters were aſſigned, might be each of them one particular congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) although the Churches planted by the Apoſtles, were not as yet di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into ſeverall pariſhes, or diſtinct congregations. And to the ſecond connexio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> propounded after the ſame ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner, which he tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:14068:180"/> in his Refuter with an <hi>if,</hi> in ſtead of <hi>when,</hi> which word his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition imbraceth; I anſwer as before to the propoſition of his former argument (ſect. 4. cap. 2.) It doth not followe, that the Presbyters were appointed to Dioceſes, (that is, to dioceſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſuch as ours) although it ſhould be graunteth, that they were appointed to labour the converſion of all that belonged to God both in citie and countrey.</p>
                     <p>Neyther doe his queſtions that follow, give him the leaſt releife, to juſtify this conſquencewhich I diſclaim, It ſemeth his meaning is to perſwade his Reader, that the denyall of his conſequence will inforce his Refuter to father this fancie; that all the people which belonged to God in the citie and countrie &amp; were afterwards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verred, belonged to one pariſh. And the abſurditie hereof (he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth) will appeare by this; that after their converſion, they were divided into many pariſhes both in citie and countrie. For anſwer, 1. I aſk why it ſhould be more abſurd to ſay, that the people of one pariſh may be (or were) divided into many pariſhes, then to ſay, that the people of one Church or Dioceſe may be &amp; were diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into many Dioceſes or Churches? but he is much deceived if he think, that the denyall of his conſequence, will drive us to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that all the people which in an whole citie &amp; countrie belonged to God as being ordeyned to life and in time to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, were to be reckoned one pariſh. For it is flatly denyed, that they did before their converſion, belong vnto any pariſh, or viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church at all. And it is a blind fancie in the Doctor to think, that becauſe they belonged to God in his election, therefore they belonged to the Citie-church; for how ſhould they be members of any viſible Church or congregation; which yet were drowned in atheiſme and inſidelitie? yet, as if he had ſufficiently fortified the propoſition or conſequence of his owne argument he leaveth it; &amp; indeavoreth to take from his Refuter the ground where on he ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in contradicting his concluſion: for he ſeemeth to grant that at the firſt all the Chriſtians in the Citie and Countrie being aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled togither; could make but a ſmall congregation: but he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth how they could be of one pariſh, before there was any pariſh at all? doe you not ſee the Doctor is wiſe enough to make his bargaine well for his own advantage, when he hath a foole in hand, that will give him all that he aſketh? for in effect he ſaith, grant me; <note place="margin">The Doct. beggeth.</note> but thus much that there was not any pariſh at all in the Apoſtles

His laſt refuge is to tell us, he hath before proved, that the circuite of the Church, and of the Biſhop or Presbyteries charge, was the ſame in purpoſe and intention at the firſt, when they were but a few, which it was afterwards in execution, when all were converted; but this diſcovereth the nakednes of his cauſe, that inforceth him to lay hold on ſo bare a covering as I have ſhewed this to be in the anſwer to his third Chapter and 6. ſection.</p>
                     <p>We have ſeen how weak his ſtaies are, whereon his propoſition <note place="margin">Sect. 3.</note> leaneth, but for his aſſuption he provideth much more weakely. <hi>It is that,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>which the Refuter himſelfe boldeth.</hi> But this defenſe (ſay I) is ſuch as the Doctor himſelfe contradicteth (pag 74.) <note place="margin">The Doct. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelf</note> and proveth to be a ſoule vntruth delivered not of ignorance, but againſt the light of his owne conſcience. For there he acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth that in his aſſumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the Refuter <hi>findeth one error repeated,</hi> which was <hi>before noted</hi> (concerning the end of the Presbyters ordination) &amp; <hi>chargeth alſo the maine points in it to be altogither void of truth.</hi> But let us heare what it is, which he ſaith his Refuter holdeth; Forſooth, <hi>that there were not in any Church many pariſhes in the Apoſtlestimes.</hi> Wel but can he fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hence conclude, that his Refuter joyneth with him in his whole aſſumption? Nay rather we may ſee a threefold trick <note place="margin">A 3. folde tricke of cunning in the D.</note> of cunning in the Doctor, namely, in changing the firſt braunch of his aſſumption, in juſtifying it by his Refuters allowance; and in concealing the other parts of his aſſumption. 1. he changeth the firſt braunch, becauſe he could neyther challenge any allowance of it from his Refuter, nor yet yeild any ſufficient reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to juſtify it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him in that ſenſe, that he taketh pariſhes in this controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy. For he knoweth that his Oppoſites define a pariſh to be a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ordinarie or ſet congregation of Chriſtians, aſſembling in one place to the ſolemne ſervice of God, (ſee pag. 4. of his ſermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) And that his Refuter holdeth the ancient Churches to be pariſhes, becauſe (although their multitude were great in ſome places, yet) each of them was one diſtinct aſſemblie guided in eccleſiaſticall matters, by their owne Presbyters (ſee anſwer. pag. 58. and this Defenſe, lib. 2. p. 74.) Wherefore, to ſay, that there were no ſuch pariſhes diſtinguiſhed in the Apoſtles times, is all one as to deny,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:14068:181"/> that in their times there were any diſtinct congregations or aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, which ordinarilie (if they were not by ſufficient cauſes hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, for this exception himſelf taketh notice of (Def. pag. 83.) aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled togither in one place to the ſolemne ſervice of God &amp;c. he thought it wiſdome therefore to let goe this point, and to ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der another in ſtead thereof, which might paſſe without control<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, viz. <hi>that in the Apoſtles times, the Churches were not divided into ſeverall pariſhes.</hi> But this argueth againſt, rather then for the D; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeing Churches which are not divided into ſeverall pariſhes (or ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles and cures for theſe are one and the ſame in the Doctors phraſe of ſpeaking) doe make but one ordinary congregation of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; they muſt needs be pariſhes, to the Refuters vnderſtanding; yea to the Doct. alſo, as he delivereth the ſtate of the queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (ſerm. pag. 4.)</p>
                     <p>2. But why doth he relie for the proofe of his owne aſſertion upon his Refuters approbation? Is it not becauſe in his owne judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there is no generall truth in it? which may appeare by his own exception; for in excepting the church of Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dria, he much weakeneth not onely his aſſuptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but his whole argument. For if his ſtudy for this defenſe hath brought him to know (what he knew not when he made the ſermon, as he acknowledgeth, pa. 93. to wit) that pariſhes were diſtinguiſhed in Alexandria, long before Euariſtus his dayes, whom he ſuppoſed to have been the firſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of that ordinance; why may not his traveile for the next bring him to find out ſome better evidence, then he hath yet atteined to, for the like diſtribution, made in ſome other Churches: yea, he hath already told us (pag 50.) that it is more then probable, that the 7. Churches of Aſia at the time of writing the Revelation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned diverſe congregations. (ſee for this point alſo ſect. 14.) And among other reaſons to make good that probability, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth, that (beſides the Churches and Presbyters that Paul &amp; Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But if there be any truth in that which his argument preſuppoſeth (to wit, that in the Apoſtles times, the Presbyteries were not appoi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>red to pariſhes, becauſe there was not in any church many pariſhesin their daies: why then ſhould there not be ſome probability (ſufficient atleaſt to weaken the conſequence of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument) in the contrary aſſertion (viz. that ſome Presbyteries
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:14068:182"/> might be appointed unto Pariſhes; ſeing ſome Churches, (as that of Alexandria for certaintie, and thoſe 7 in Aſia, in very great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilitie) were even in the Apoſtles times diſtinguiſhed into ſeveral pariſhes.</p>
                     <p>3. As for the reſt of the branches of his Aſſumption; when he ſhould make proofe of them, he wholly ſilenceth them (not of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance or forgetfulnes, but) of purpoſe, becauſe he found it eaſier to wrangle with his Refuter, about ſome parts of his anſwer, then to propoſe any ſound argument; for the juſtifying of the points impugned; which is in deed the perpetuall courſe of this great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puter for the moſt part.</p>
                     <p>But let us ſee whether he hath ſo juſt cauſe as he ſuppofeth, to <note place="margin">Sect. 4.</note> inſult over his Refuter, when he ſaith (to let paſſe his ſcoffs more fit for a vice in a play then a Doctor of divinitie, in re tam ſeria as this is) that his Refuter <hi>wrangleth &amp; as a man confounded, yet reſolved, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ntradict, though againſt the light of his conſcience, denieth the concluſion, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicteth himſelfe.</hi> The contradiction objected, will come to be examined, in his defenſe of the Aſſumption. All that is ſayd to wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the conſequence or propoſition, he taketh to be but a bare de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall of the concluſion. And firſt he ſo conceiveth of his quaeſtion (what if every one of the Churches then, were but one pariſh &amp;c.) becauſe he cannot ſee, how it impugneth the conſequence, in any reſpect. But had he had ſo much charitie towards his Refuter as he would have yeelded to himſelfe, he might have ſupplied that which the ſtate of the queſtion, and the ſcope of his anſwer requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, to be neceſſarily underſtood q. d. what if (though that were granted which he ſuppoſeth) every one of the Churches then were but one pariſh, which by reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the multitude of people had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Teachers? ſo he might have ſeen, that he impugneth his conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; ſo farre as it inferreth, that the Presbyteries were not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed unto pariſhes: and that therfore, he both wrongeth him to ſay, that in that reſpect he giveth it no anſwer at all; and ſporteth himſelfe in vaine with the hope of a victorie that turneth to his ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine. For his quaeſtion rightly conceived (as before is ſhewed) doth in plaine phraſe of ſpeaking import thus much. q. d. Be it granted that pariſhes in the Apoſtles times, were not diſtinguiſhed in any citie and the country nere adjoyning, nor presbyters aſſigned to their ſeverall cures? this nothing hindreth, but that every one of the Churches, which by their ordination injoyed a presbyterie (or
<pb facs="tcp:14068:182"/> companie of teachers) might be one pariſh; that is, one ordinarie congregation of Chriſtians aſſembling togither, in one place. And that which is added touching the French &amp; Dutch Churches, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth (not to prove the maine concluſion, as the Doctor ſuppoſeth, therein miſtaking his Refuters Analyſis; but) to juſtify the deniall of the conſequence, by a paralel comparing thoſe outlandiſh chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, here in England, with the ancient Apoſtolike Churches in this manner;</p>
                     <p>It is well knowne that the French and Dutch Churches here in England have firſt a presbyterie or company of Teachers allotted to them, 2. no pariſhes diſtinguiſhed in any citie for them. 3. nor presbyters ſo aſſigned to their ſeveral cures, as our pariſh Miniſters are. Be it alſo graunted that the Apoſtolike Churches in cities had the like: yet the French and Dutch Churches are, (neyther doth the want of diſtinct pariſhes, and presbyters aſſigned to their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall cures, hinder their being) each of them, one pariſhionall (&amp; not a dioceſan) aſſembly, that is, one ordinarie congregation of Chriſtians, aſſembling togither in one place. Why then might not thoſe Apoſtolike Churches be, yea how ſhould the want of diſtinct pariſhes &amp;c. hinder their like being? If the Doctor will needs have the compariſon brought into a ſyllogiſm, it may be thus framed.</p>

                     <p>And this alſo (by the way) weakneth his arguing, to ſhew that <note place="margin">Sect. 6.</note> the French and Dutch Churches among us, are no pariſh aſſemblies.

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:14068:185"/> were appointed either to dioceſes as he ſaith, or elſe to ſuch pariſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es as we ſpoke of. The diſproof therefore of his dioceſes, is a direct proofe of our pariſhes. The which the Doctor (as it ſeemeth fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing, falleth vpon the examination of the argument, which run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth thus,</p>
                     <p>If there were no pariſhes diſtinguiſhed in the Apoſtles times; then <note place="margin">Sect. 1.</note> there were no dioceſes, ſuch as ours; (for every ſuch dioceſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth of diverſe diſtinct pariſhes)</p>
                     <p>But in the Apoſtles times there were no pariſhes diſtinguiſhed. Therefore neither were there any dioceſes in their daies, ſuch as ours are.</p>
                     <p>How neceſſary this clauſe, <hi>dioceſes ſuch as ours,</hi> is, I have ſhewed heretofore, becauſe <hi>Biſhops ſuch as ours</hi> cannot be had without dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſes ſuch as ours. And here it maketh the conſequence of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument as cleare as the Sun in a cleare ſummers day. Yet the Doct. denieth it; becauſe he imagineth that the dioceſe was the ſame, and the circuit of the ſpirituall juriſdiction intended, the ſame, before pariſhes were divided, with that it was after they were divided, that is, anſwerable to the civil: but that is coleworts more then thrice ſodden, the falſhood and vanity of which evaſion is already ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently diſcovered, in the anſwere to his 3. cap. ſect. 6. &amp; 8.</p>
                     <p>It ſhall here ſuffice in one word to remember him of this, that his owne wordes doe convince, that the want of pariſhes diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, argueth there were no dioceſes ſuch as ours, which in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution (and not intention onely) comprize all the inhabitants of City and Country. I might put him in minde of another diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, betwixt our and the ancient dioceſes, which in circuite (as he ſaith) anſwered to the civill; ſeing ours doe not ſo; for ſome of them conteyn many ſhires within their circuite: and ſundry ſhires are diſmembred by the ſpirituall juriſdiction, which draweth them to ſeverall dioceſes. But let us ſee how he removeth the piller, that vpholdeth the conſequence of the argument, viz. <hi>that every dioceſe (ſuch as ours) conſistech of diſtinct pariſhes. It is true (ſaith he) after the distinction of pariſhes, but not before.</hi> But is not this anſwere <hi>miſerune</hi>

                        <hi>kerſphogeton)</hi> an abſurd evaſion, and no better then a very denyall of the concluſion? For (to borrow the Doctors compariſions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore applied to the queſtion of dioceſes and their circuit, pag. 53.) when he ſaith, that every man conſiſteth of ſoul and body; and the body conſiſteth of many members; if one ſhould anſwere him,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:14068:185"/> 
                        <hi>It is true, that a man</hi> conſiſteth of thoſe parts, after the conjunction but not before; and the body hath many members after the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the members, but not before; would he not cenſure him for an abſurd caviller, and his anſwere for a poore evaſion of <hi>one</hi> that is at a non-plus; yet ſuch and none other is the Doctors an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. And. 2. that it may appeare to what purpoſe his anſwer ſerveth, I will here frame the argument, that fortifieth the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence before denied, and leave it to the readers judgment, to give ſentence betwixt the Doctor and the Refuter in this cafe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Whatſoever conſiſteth of diſtinct pariſhes, that cannot have his being or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence, before pariſhes were distinguiſhed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But every Dioceſe (ſuch as ours) conſisteth of diſtinct Pariſhes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>No Dioceſe therefore (ſuch as ours) can have any being or ſubſistence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there be a diſtinction of Pariſhes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now to anſwer as he doth, <hi>that the aſſumption is true after pariſhes were distinguiſhed, but not before;</hi> is it not all one in effect as if he had ſayde, that there may be and were dioceſes, before there there were any pariſhes? ſo that vnder a pretence of contradicting the aſſumption, with a frivolous diſtinction, he doth in deed (as a man amazed or rather confounded) deny the concluſion.</p>
                     <p>As for the compariſions, borrowed by him, to juſtify his anſwer, <note place="margin">Sect. 9.</note> they fall farre ſhort of his purpoſe. Firſt he ſaith, <hi>a batch of bread con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſisteth of many loaves after the diſtinction, which before it conteyned undiſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed in the lumpe.</hi> But, he muſt remember, that a Dioceſe doth ſo conſiſt of many pariſhes, as a Province doth of many dioceſes; and a Patriatchſhip of many provinces. Wherefore as he confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that Metropolitan Biſhops and Patriarcks (and conſequently provinciall and patriarchall Churches) grewe &amp; followed, th'one, upon the combination of Dioceſes, and the other vpon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation of Provinces (lib. 4. pag. 7) ſo his Refuter holdeth that theſe Dioceſan Churches and Biſhops, had their originall, from the conjunction of many particular congregations ſubjected to one Dioceſan conſiſtorie. And it is evident ſo to be, in aſmuch as, the firſt Churches planted in cities by the Apoſtles, were for a while (as the Doctor himſelfe confeſſeth pag. 6. and 103.) but a ſmall congregation; and when more were converted then could well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble togither in one ordinarie congregation, the congregations were divided; &amp; ſtill as people in divers places were converted, the Churches (as he alſo acknowledgeth pag. 67.) were multiplied;
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:14068:186"/> ſo that the many pariſhes which grewe up in a dioceſe, were not all diſtinguiſhed at once, as the loaves of one Bach are, after the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning of the whole lump. And therefore neither were they all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned within the bowels of the citie-church undiſtiguiſhed, as the loaves are in the lumpe before their diviſion: but rather as the firſt conſtituted Churches conſiſted of diverſe families, but by the combyning of many chriſtian families in one eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call aſſembly: ſo alſo they became (in proceſs of time) dioceſan and provinciall Churches; not by reteyning all the Chriſtians of an whole dioceſe or province in one confuſed lump till all were leave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; but by conſociating many particular Churches (which were diſtinguiſhed, ſome at one time, and ſome at another, as the nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber dayly increaſed,) vnder the the overſight of one dioceſe or provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Biſhop.</p>
                     <p>His ſecond compariſion (of a man who conſiſteth of many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct members after they are diſtinguiſhed, which at his firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, were not diſtinct) if it be well weighed maketh more for his Refuter then for himſelf. For as it is willingly granted, that a man in his firſt conception hath no diſtinct members; ſo it is as freely profeſſed, that it is no man, to ſpeak properly; much leſs is it ſuch a man as the Doctor is. Wherefore that which he preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth in his compariſon, viz. that the Churches planted by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, before pariſhes were multiplied in the cities and countries annexed, were Dioceſes; even ſo, as a womans ofſpring is a man, before the parts of an humane body are formed and diſtinguiſhed: this I ſay argueth with the Refuter and againſt the Doctor, that <note place="margin">The D. ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and for the Refut.</note> it is no leſs abſurd to ſay, that the firſt Apoſtolike Churches, which had no pariſhes diſtinguiſhed in their circuite, were notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding properly Dioceſes, yea ſuch as ours are at this day; then to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that a childe in his firſt conception, before the parts of his body are framed, is yet properly a man, yea ſuch a man as all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. that are borne and converſe among men.</p>
                     <p>We have heard how well he hath beſtowed his paines for reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie <note place="margin">Sect. 10. ad ſect. 6. pag. 73.</note> of his propoſition out of his Refut: hands; it remaineth that we attend what he ſaith, for the reſcuing of his aſſumption, which hath theſe parts. 1. that pariſhes were not diſtinguiſhed in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles times. 2. that Presbyters were not aſſigned to their ſeverall cures. 3. that they were not onely to attend the whole flock con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:14068:186"/> but alſo to labour the converſion of the reſidue. 4. and that in both theſe duties they muſt labour in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon. In what ſenſe the firſt is contradicted by the Refuter we have ſeen before (ſect. 3.) where was alſo noted how farre it differeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which he now giveth in ſtead thereof. viz. that the Churches planted in cities (as at Epheſus. Antioch &amp;c.) were not in the Apoſtles times divided into Pariſhes; from whence he may recieve a direct anſwer (which here he expecteth) to his queſtion, (whither the Churches were tho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> divided into pariſhes or not?) viz. that although the Apoſtles did diſtinguiſh pariſhes, by conſtituting particular congregations, in ſeverall places, (that is, in each towne or citie that enterteyned the faith, one Church-aſſembly; yet none of the Churches which they eſtabliſhed in any towne or citie, was in their times ſubdivided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſeverall pariſh aſſemblies. But what ſhall we ſay to that two hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned argument, which thus diſputeth for his advantage? <hi>If the Churches were divided into pariſhes in the Apoſtles times (as at Alexandria it ſeemeth to have beene) then was not every Church but one pariſh: Iſ they were not; then the Preſbyters were not aſſigned to their ſeverall cures; and ſo the Aſſumption is true.</hi> The Doctor taketh on imediately after theſe words againſt his Refuter, for being <hi>tranſported with a ſpirit of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction;</hi> whereof by and by; in the meane time, is not the Doctor <note place="margin">The Doct. contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth him.</note> himſelfe a ſtrange kind of diſputer, that will contradict one branch of his owne aſſumption, to juſtify his maine concluſion; and yet aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the ſame, to confirme another part of his aſſumption, and then make his boaſt that his whole aſſumption is true? But to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer him in kind, thus I reply; If the Churches were divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to pariſhes in the Apoſtles times; then his aſſumption in the firſt branch is falſe: if they were not, then each Church in their times, was but one pariſh, (that is to ſay, one congregation) and ſo he er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in his maine concluſion. And that he may ſee, I uſe not this regeſtion; becauſe his argument hath put his Refuter to a nonplus; for a more direct anſwere, I give him to wit, that his firſt horn hath a weak conſequence; &amp; his ſecond is ſophyſticall. The one is weak, beauſe that which maketh an, Church, bearing the name of this or that citie, (as the Church of London or Sarum) to be more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one pariſh, is not the diſtribution of the people of each dioceſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to many pariſhes; but the combining of the pariſhes ſo divided, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one Dioceſan body. If therefore, he will prove the Church of Alexandria, or any other which he ſuppoſeth to have been divided
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:14068:187"/> into ſundry pariſhes in the Apoſtles times, not to be one pariſh, he muſt make demonſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that which he often averreth, but ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver proveth by any teſtimony divine or humane, to wit, that the pariſhes which iſſued out of the citie-church by ſuch diviſion, were ſubordinated to her juriſdiction, as daughter churches to their Mother. The other is ſophyſticall, becauſe, in ſaying the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters were not aſſigned to ſeverall pariſhes, untill the Churches were divided into pariſhes, he taketh the Presbyters not joyntly for the Presbyteries whereof his concluſion ſpeaketh, but ſingly for each Presbyter or Miniſter apart. For we may grant that the aſſignement of one Presbyter to take the charge of one pariſh, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed (in courſe of time) the multiplying of pariſhes in one Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſe; and yet mainteyne that Presbyteries were appointed to ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall pariſhes, (that is to ſay, to particular congregations) before a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Church planted in cities by the Apoſtles, was divided into ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall pariſhes. Wherefore, had the Doctor regarded in what ſenſe the Refut: taketh theſe words; <hi>Preſbyters and Pariſhes or ſeverall Cures;</hi> when he denieth the two firſt branches of his aſſumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; he would never have made ſo ſrivolous a flouriſh, as he doth, (both here &amp; afterwards, pag. 76) of a falſe conceited contradiction for his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion that <hi>every of the Apostolike churches was but one pariſh,</hi> made him to cenſure the aſſumption as voyd of truth, in that it denieth pariſhes to be diſtinguiſhed in the Apoſtles times; and the presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters (or Presbyteries ordeyned by them) to be aſſigned unto their diſtinct charges. Neyther ſhall the Doctor ever be able to prove (though he ſtrive til his heart ake) that in this impugning of his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, he contradicteth his owne perſwaſion formerly delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                     <p>But let us ſee how he freeth his aſſumption from the errors or <note place="margin">Sectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 11. ad pag. 74.</note> untruthes objected againſt it? Firſt touching the third point be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſet downe, viz. that the Presbyters were not onely to attend the converted, but labour the converſion of the reſidue; he was told that it was but the repetition of an errour, before noted in the former argument: whereto he anſwereth nothing, but that he hath proved it to be an evident truth. Wherefore his proofes being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, the errour remaineth unſalved. And the repetition of it (ſeing he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſeth it to be of greateſt force to prove that the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries were appointed to Dioceſes. pa. 70.) argueth him to have ill diſtinguiſhed his arguments, ſeing the two are in effect but one,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:14068:187"/> yea one error twice produced for two diſtinct arguments. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the laſt point (of the Presbyters attendance on their charge in <note place="margin">The D. 2. arguments are in effect but one, yea one er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour twice produced for two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct arg.</note> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon) which is rejected as unworthy to be aſcribed to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles appointment or allowance; &amp; that for this reaſon following, <hi>It is at no hand to be indured that the Apoſtles ſhould be ſuſpected, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point or allow of any diſorderly confuſion. But to ordeyne many Preſbyters or Miniſters in comon to attend, not onely the feeding of the whole flock conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but alſo to labour the converſion of the reſidue in the citie and countrey ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyning: is to authorize and give allowance to a diſordely confuſion. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is at no hand to be indured, that the Apoſtles ſhould be ſuspected to have ordeyned many Preſbyters or Ministers for ſuch attendance in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The propoſition cannot be doubted of, neyther taketh the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor any exception againſt it. The aſſumption he contradicteth, but anſwereth not the probabilities urged to cleare it. And firſt the diſorder and confuſion is declared by a like example, of a ſchoole erected in ſome great towne, by ſome great ſcholler, who (having entred his Auditors in the principles of grammer, &amp; being drawne away by ſome occaſions) appointeth certeyne Vſhers in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to take care of all that were ſo entred, and to gaine as many more as they could, not of the ſame towne onely, but of all other townes round about. Now if they thus left to their libertie, ſhall goe now hither now thither, and teach now theſe, now thoſe, as it beſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth himſelfe and them; is it not likely (think yet) that there would be good teaching and learning in ſuch a ſchoole? To this cafe, the Doctor maketh no other anſwer but this; <hi>that he is worthy to be put into a cloakbagg which propoſed it;</hi> but is not himſelfe more worthy of the cloak bagg, that could finde no better anſwer? Surely if his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futer had made ſuch an anſwer he would have ſayd ſo; but I will not, for he ſheweth himſelf to have wit enough to ſcoffe it out, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is at a non-plus. For ſeing he ſheweth not the diſſagreement of the things compared togither, who ſeeth not reaſon to think, the compariſon is much fitter then he would have it. 2. Againe the Refuter asketh how ſuch a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon imployment (of preaching here and there at randon) could be orderly then, ſince it was afterwards diſorderly: (for the Doctor acknowledgeth (ſerm. pag. 20.) that this promiſcuous attendance, was taken away by Euariſtus, for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyding confuſion). And 3. he alſo intimateth, that ſchiſmes muſt needes enſue, when the people being tied to the hearing of no one preacher, might upon their fancie run ſome after one, ſome after
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:14068:188"/> an other, and ſo peradventure leave ſome quite without auditors. To all which the Doctor in his diſcretion giveth his grave conſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>re; <hi>That which he (meaning the Refuter) bebleth concerning diſorder and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, is wholly to be aſcribed to his owne distemper and confuſion.</hi>
                     </p>

Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in therefore behoid, and pitty the Doctors poore and weak eſtare,

Now; (for want of better help, to wipe away that diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and confuſio objected againſt that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon imployment, which his conceit aſcribeth to the Presbyters ordeyned by the Apoſtles) he is faine to apprehend the ſame compariſon; &amp; to conceale that diſagreement, which (though then it were impertinently urged, yet now) ſerveth well to ſhewe, how weakly or rather diſceitfully he diſputeth. For although in one congregation aſſembling in one place, many Miniſters may without confuſion, teach at ſeverall times one after another (as it was in the Church of Corinth. 1. Cor. 14. 31. and now is in the French churches) yet may it be, (yea it is already proved to be) diſorderly for many Miniſters to attend promiſcuouſly and at their pleaſure, ſometimes on the feeding of a people converted and that eyther in whole or in part; and ſometimes on the inſtructing of ſuch, as in an whole citie &amp; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey adjoyning doe yet remayne in unbeleefe. Moreover, it is well knowne that there is no ſuch co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munitie in the charge which the French and Dutch Miniſters have of one congregation, as he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributeth to the Presbyters firſt ordeyned by the Apoſtles; for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong theſe the Doctor giveth no cheiftie or preheminence to any one above the reſt, neyther perpetual not te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porarie, in any Paſtoral duty of feeding or governing the people depending on them; ſeing in his conceit they had neither Biſhop nor Preſident, to guide the, or to moderate their meetings, in the abſence of the Apoſtles; who (as he ſuppoſeth) reteyned all epiſcopall government in their owne hands. Which confuſed paritie, or rather Anarchie, as it was never imbraced of any reformed Church in theſe laſt times: ſo it cannot without wrong &amp; diſgrace to the Apoſtles, be aſcribed unto their ordinance.</p>
                     <p>As for the Apoſtles wordes to the Presbyters of Epheſus, Acts. 20. 28. the Doctor ſeemeth inconſtant, and at odds with himſelfe <note place="margin">Sect. 13. ad ſect. 7. p. 75.</note> in the application of them. For he firſt quoted that text (ſerm. p. 18.) to prove that the Presbyters were in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to attend the whole flock converted, feeding them with the word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; where note that he limiteth the word <hi>flock</hi> and the duty of <hi>feeding</hi> to the company already converted; which argueth (as may
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:14068:189"/> well be ſuppoſed) that he did not then conceive, the reſidue of the City and Country yet vnconverted to be any part of that flock or <note place="margin">The D. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth not with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in the applicatio of Act. 20. 29.</note> Church there ſpoken of: but now he ſtreatcheth both words to the whole nomber of all, which in City and Country belonged to God, and were by their Miniſterie to be converted; and rockoneth it (as we heard before ſect. 7.) one of the Refuters indigeſted fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, to reſtreine the flock over which thoſe presbyters were ſet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the nomber of Chriſtians already converted. Heare we now the reaſons that perſwaded him to change his opinion; for he uſeth not to doe and vndoe without reaſon.

Doth not himſelfe weaken the conſequence when he faith. <hi>This is ſpoken of the Church in generall?</hi> yea, but he proceedeth to ſay, <hi>ſo the company of them that belong to Christ, in any nation, province, dioceſe, city, or pariſh, may be called the flock, the Church, the people of God.</hi> Well then, if the company of faithfull in one pariſh may be called the <hi>flock</hi> and <hi>Church</hi> of God, aſwell as a larger ſociety of ſuch as belonge vnto God, in a nation province or dioceſe; is not the Doctor yet, as farre to ſeek as at the firſt, for a found reaſon to perſwade his conſcience, that the people yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, but belonging to Gods election, throughout the dioceſe or province of Epheſus, were a part of the flock and Church, which thoſe presbyters were charged to attend to and feede; May not a man with halfe an eye diſcerne, that a greedy deſire to contradict his Refuters aſſertion, hath inſtead of better reaſon preveyled with him; or rather (as he wrongfully chargeth his Refuter pag. 73.) ſo tranſported him, that he careth not how ſhamefully, he contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicteth himſelfe; ſo as he may gaineſay his adverſaries preſent aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

By all which layd togither, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that this argument of his, <hi>(ſeparatis ſeparandis)</hi> is nothing elſe but a concluding of the ſame by the ſame in this manner; In the Apoſtles times the Presbyters were not aſſigned to ſeverall cures (whereby he meaneth pariſhes.) Ergo, in their times they were not appointed to pariſhes. But to come to his inference; deduced from the place of the Acts. which he quoted; if that be true which his words intimate; <hi>that ſeverall pariſhes were parts of the flock, which the Preſbyters were charged to attend;</hi> how can there be a truth in the firſt branch of the Aſſumption, which denieth pariſhes to be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed in the Apoſtles times? muſt he not fall, an aſe at leaſt, low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then before, when he ſayd (pag. 63. ſect. 6.) that his aſſertion touching Churches not divided into pariſhes, is to be underſtood <hi>

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:14068:190"/> flock could be undiſtinguiſhed, or attended on in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon; if the charge given to the Presbyters were ſuch, as upon like occaſion might by a Biſhop, in his viſitation be applied to all the Miniſters of a Dioceſe?

                           </gap>hoppeth &amp; chageth</note> pleaſure, that firſt branch of his aſſumption. For whereas at the firſt it ſimply denied pariſhes to be diſtinguiſhed in the Apoſtles times; now he maketh it to deny no other diſtinction of pariſhes, then the diviſion of one pariſh into many. For as often before, ſo now and againe muſt I ring it into his eares; that when his Refuter holdeth in this queſtion, the Apoſtolike Churches to be pariſhes, his meaning is (as the Doctor knoweth very well) that each of thoſe Churches was but one particular congregation. If then it be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that the word ECCLESIA <hi>Church,</hi> doth nor in the Apoſtolike writings ſignify any other outward co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>opany of men, the ſuch as were gathered into one particular aſſemblie; it will follow that the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Churches, to which that word is referred in their writings, muſt be acknowledged to be pariſhes, and conſequently there can be no truth in that aſſumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which denieth pariſhes to be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, and presbyters aſſigned to ſeverall pariſhes. But rather then the diſgrace of any untruth ſhall lie upon the Doctors aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, he will reject the aſſumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his Refuters argument; which denieth the word <hi>eccleſia</hi> to ſignify any other outward company of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:14068:190"/> men, then a particular congregation onely. For he telleth us, <hi>he hath already ſayd more to confute that ignorant conceit, then will be anſwered in haſt.</hi> But for ought he hath alleadged from the ſcripture (which is the onely guide of the conſcience in queſtions of this nature) more hath been ſayd to confute his ſlender objections, then upon his third thoughts he wilbe able to produce for the fortifying of them. And as for that he here addeth touching the word <hi>poimonion or poimne,</hi> it diſcovereth his will to be more then his ſtrength to confute any thing his refuter hath delivered. Firſt, whereas he had ſayd, that <hi>the word,</hi> (to wit, the Engliſh word <hi>flock,</hi> (for the gr: word was not at all mencioned) <hi>is ordinarily uſed, of beasts &amp; fowles that heird and flock togither in one company;</hi> the Doctor falſly chargeth him to have ſayd, <hi>that the word</hi> poimnion, <hi>or</hi> poimne <hi>is ſo vſed,</hi> and then (in great modeſtie) profeſſeth <hi>it is beyond the compaſſe of his reading</hi> &amp;c which is but to fight with his owne ſhadowe; for he ſhould (if with truth he could) have ſayd, that he never read or heard the word <hi>flock</hi> applyed to fowles. Secondly, it is to no purpoſe to tell us, that the flock of Chriſts ſheep mencioned, Luk. 12. 32, and Ioh. 10. 16. <hi>is not one onely particular congregation;</hi> unleſſe he could ſay and prove, that the word in thoſe places ſignifieth an outward compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of men making one viſible Church, of larger extent (to uſe his owne words, pag. 75) then one onely aſſembly. But himſelfe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth (as the truth is) that in Iohn, 10. 16. the vniverſall Church of Chriſt (which comprehendeth the elect yet unconverted and therefore is inviſible) is vnderſtood by that one flock, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he is the great ſhepheard. And that little flock to whom he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, Luc. 12. 32. <hi>feare not little flock &amp;c.</hi> is none other then that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of his diſciples, which then were his hearers, and as a little flock or congregation, cleaved to him as their Paſtor and Teacher; as appeareth by the text it ſelfe, verſ. 1. 22. 32. 41. and (beſides the judgement of many worthy divines writing thereon) the vſe of the word to the ſame purpoſe elſwhere, as Math. 26. 31. Wherefore, the Doctor hath nothing worth the objecting againſt that aſſertio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his Refuter, which affirmeth the flock and Church, whereto the Presbyters were aſſigned, Act. 20. 28. to be one onely particular congregation; ſo that if he will ſtand (as he ſeemeth to be willing) to the judgement of the judicious Reader, I make no doubt but he wilbe found (as his Refuter firſt tolde him) to have dealt full weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a point of ſo great importance.</p>

And he which peruſeth Mr. Iacobs booke (intitled reaſons &amp;c. proving a neceſſity of reforming our churches) fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence the D. draweth that extent of 200 yeares) ſhall ſee, that aſwell concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Churches as Biſhops, he diſtinctly handleth. Firſt what they are and ought to be by divine, or Apoſtolicall ordinance; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards what their ſtate and condition was, for the firſt 200 yeares after Chriſt. And although the Doctor in that concluſion which he tendreth to be proved (ſerm. pag. 17.) mencioneth the age following the Apoſtles times; yet he tieth not himſelfe to that terme, neyther in the arguments firſt propoſed by him, nor yet in this defenſe hitherto continued. Nay his arguments doe bound themſelves within the Apoſtles daies; &amp; the later, which generally concerne the ancient viſible churches are directly bent againſt that firſt aſſertion of theirs, which ſaith, <hi>The viſible Churches inſtituted by the Apoſtles, were properly Pariſhes, (that is particular congregations) &amp; not Dioceſes.</hi> But however the D. may at his pleaſure, wholly leave out the age following, or wander for his proofes beyond that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But ſeeing the queſtions are diſtinct and require confirmation by teſtimonies of a differing nature (for the ſcriptures muſt determine what was the forme or conſtitution of Churches inſtituted by the Apoſtles; and we muſt ſearch after humane teſtimonies to find out the firſt orginall, of multiplying of pariſhes in cities, &amp; of combyning many congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, in one dioceſan body) I will therefore (with the Doct. leave) firſt take a view of that which is objected &amp; anſwered tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the ſtate of the Churches, which were of greateſt note in the Apoſtles times.</p>

                     <p>Now to proceed to the confirmation of the Antecedent before <note place="margin">Sect. 3. ad 79.</note> mencioned; (viz. that the presbyteries (and their preſidents) or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned by the Apoſtles were aſſigned, each of them, but to one particular ordinarie congregation, aſſebling togither in one place) the Doctor hath no cauſe to blame us, though we ſhould refuſe to mainteyne the argument, which he framed for us; for I ſuppoſe, none of our ſide were ſo fooliſh, as to deliver for the proof thereof, that aſſertion which he tendreth to us; to wit, <hi>that in the firſt 200. yeares, all the Christians in any one great citie, made but one ſuch congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Wherefore till he produce his Authour, from whom he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this argument; I will pray leave to think, he forged it, for his owne advantage, that his reader might judge he hath gotten the conqueſt, though he onely threwe downe a rotten poſt of his own ſetting up. For to conclude the former Antecedent it might ſuffice to aſſume thus much; to wit, that all the members of thoſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:14068:192"/> wherevnto the Presbyteries were ordeyned by the Apoſtles made but one particular ordinary congregation aſſembled togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one place. Againſt which propoſition (rightly vnderſtood of the time, when the Churches received their Presbyteries and preſidents by the Apoſtles ordination) I find no juſt exception ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, eyther in his ſermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: or this defenſe; ſeing in both he wandreth beyond the Apoſtles dayes, to the age following; whereof he had not ſpoken one word in all that he hath urged hitherto for the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying of his mayne concluſion. Seing then the queſtion is what the number of Chriſtians was, at the time of giving presbyteries to them; if we ſay, they exceeded not one congregation; is it not a frivolous cavill to anſwere, that they farre exceeded the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one congregation, in the next age following and the later part thereof? It is apparant therefore, that theſe clauſes in the <hi>first two hundred yeares,</hi> &amp; in <hi>the age following the Apoſtles,</hi> were inſerted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this queſtion by the Doctor (both here and afterwards pa. 100) onely to give him ſome colour of a juſt exception, againſt his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futers reaſoning; and ſome excuſe for his ſliding from the ſtate of the Churches in the Apoſtles times, to the ages following.</p>
                     <p>But let us ſee, how he impugneth the argument framed by him <note place="margin">ſect. 4. 2d 79. &amp; 80.</note> ſelfe in this Enthymem. In the firſt two hundred yeares all the Chriſtians in any one great citie made but one particular ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie congregation aſſembled in one place. Therefore, both the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterie and the preſident thereof, were aſſigned but to one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation. Firſt he denieth the conſequence vpon this ground; that the Presbyters were provided not onely for the cities them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but alſo for the countries adjoyning; and in both, aſwell to labour the converſion of the reſt, as to take charge of them, that were already converted. Which being nothing but a repetition of that he before affirmed, nakedly and without any proofe; his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futer thought it enough to tell him, that in aſmuch as he hath before ſhewed his anſwere to be falſe, the conſequence will remain good notwithſtanding. And ſince he now boaſteth that he hath proved his Refuters affertio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> oppoſed againſt his anſwere, (viz. that it was no part of the presbyters proper dutie, to labour the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the unconverted, throughout the citie and country ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning;) <hi>to be an indigested fancie of ſhallow (if not gidd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Wherfore his cenſure paſſed againſt his Refuter more properly belongeth to himſelfe, viz. that he ſlubbereth over the proofe of his owne argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as having a better faculty in denying conſequences, then in proving any of the premiſſes, whereon his cauſe relieth; yet as if his dreames were Oracles, he ſaith (and indeed onely ſaith it, for proofe he can yeild none) <hi>that the ancient Church of God in all places understood the Apoſtles instent, as he expoundeth it.</hi> He addeth, when all both in citie and countrie were converted to the profeſſion of the faith (which could ſcarceſly be verified of any citie &amp; country for 300 yeares, after the Apoſtles began to place Presbyters in Cities, I meane till conſtantines daies as the Doctor obſerveth pag 54) they acknowledged the generally care and inſpection over them all to belong to that one Biſhop of the citie; and themſelves to be part of that Church; and therefore concludeth that the conſequence of the former Enthymem, will never be made good. But the Reader may ſee how the D. is deceived in imagining that the former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence is beaten downe by the ſtrength of this laſt; if he will take notice of that which he now aſſumeth, contrived for his beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, to conclude, his purpoſe in forme of argument to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;</p>

                     <p>All that acknowledged themſelwes after their converſion, to be partes of any citie Church &amp;c. were from the beginning partes of that Church &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>But all the people which inhabited the ſeverall dioceſes of any province, as ſoon as they were converted to the faith (notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they enjoyed their own Biſhops to governe them, yet) they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged themſelves to be parts of the metropolitane Church ſeated in that cheife citie; &amp; the Biſhop therof to be their primate, or head. All the people therefore, which inhabited the ſeverall dioceſes of any Province were from the beginning parts of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitane Church, or at leaſt, parts of the charge of the Biſhop and Presbyterie ſeated in the mother citie. And conſequently the Churches and Biſhops of Mother cities, were (in their firſt founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) properly provinciall, and not dioceſan onely. The aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of this Syllogiſme is the ſame with that which the D. avou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth lib. 2. p. 113. lin 25. 29.

                     <p>As for the Antecedent of the former Enthymem, which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecteth <note place="margin">Sect. 5. ad pag. 81.</note> with much diſdeine; (but with little ſhew of reaſon to him that weigheth the matter) becauſe it belongeth to another queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (as is before noted) I referre the handling of it to another place; for the preſent, it ſhall ſuffice to diſcharge the Refuter from thoſe
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:14068:194"/> calumniations, which the D. throweth on him, for exchanging it with this Aſſertion. <hi>All the Chriſtians in any great citie and the townes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, (vnleſſe there were distinct Churches in thoſe townes) made but one particular ordinary congregation aſſembled in one place.

But the Doctor is timorous and <hi>feareth to be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented with the incloſure of that parentheſis</hi> (unleſſe there were diſtinct Churches in thoſe townes) and therefore he would faine have it to be removed, or rather the word <hi>although</hi> to be ſet in ſtead of <hi>unleſſe;</hi> where we may ſee the old proverb verefied in him, <hi>give him an inche and he will take an ell;</hi> was his Refuters liberalitie nothing worth, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was content to annexe unto the citie, the towns adjoyning that had any diſtinct Church in them? Did the Doctor at firſt find him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe able, to confound the former Antecedent (which ſpake one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Chriſtians that were within the citie) and to prove it not onely falſe but alſo unreaſonable and incredible? And is he nowe too weak to conſute that aſſertion, which (for his advantage) is tendred to him in ſtead of the former? viz. that all the Churches in any great citie and ſuch townes adjoyning as had not any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Church in them, made but one particular congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? muſt he haue all the townes annexed to the citie; and this alſo freely gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that in ſome of thoſe townes, there were diſtinct Churches? blame him not though he affect this well; for he findeth himſelfe man good enough, to incounter with ſuch an aſſertion as this (if his Refuter would mainteyne it againſt him,) viz. that all the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in a great citie, and the townes adjoyning (though there were diſtinct Churches in ſome of thoſe townes) made but one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar congregation. Meane while, to caſe his hart of that forecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited feare, which the ſight of the parentheſis (in his Refuters Antecede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t) caſt him into; 1. he ſporteth himſelf with ſome unſavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie jeſts, which argueth that the <hi>ridiculum caput</hi> (he ſpeaketh of) cleaveth cloſe to his owne ſhoulders; and at length full ſoberly he undertaketh to ſhewe, that the incloſure before me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned, bewray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>both weaknes in the conſequence, and falſhood in the Antecedent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt touching the conſequence, he judgeth it as weak as the <note place="margin">Sect. 6.</note> former, becauſe he ſeeth not, <hi>to what purpoſe the townes are added be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:14068:194"/> the pariſhes be excepted.</hi> The former overmuch mirth of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, hath (as it ſeemeth) marred his memorie, for he ſawe well enough before, to what purpoſe the townes were added; namely to ſtrengthen the conſequence of the firſt Enthymem framed by himſelf, againſt one branch of his anſwere, which affirmed the Presbyters to be divided aſwell for the country as citie. For the Refuter (deſirous to come as neere to the Doctor as the truth will give leave) acknowledgeth that the Chriſtians which inhabited the townes or country round about the citie, made their repaire vnto the citie, there to joyn with the inhabitants thereof in the publick worſhip of God, till their number ſo increaſed, that they might conveniently enjoy a diſtinct Church, in ſome one, or moe of thoſe townes. And as it was meet the Refuter ſhould yeeld ſo farre to the Doctor: ſo is it abſurd and againſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſenſe; he ſhould be denied to except thoſe townes, that had a diſtinct Church ſeated in them. But will you ſee how ſtrongly the Doctor impugneth the conſequence, as it now ſtandeth, with this inartificiall argument, q. d, I cannot ſee to what purpoſe that addition ſerveth. Therefore this later conſequence is altogither as weak as the former. Had the Refut: at any time argued ſo looſely, to infringe any of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors conſequences; he had been worthy to beare this cenſure, <hi>that his facultie is better in denying conſequences; then in proving them.</hi> But the Doctor (not being yet returned to his right temper) at this time is to be borne with not onely for this fault; but alſo for a worſe in charging the Antecedent of <hi>falſhood,</hi> when he hath nothing to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge that directly impugneth it: yet let us give him the hearing; <hi>By this incluſure</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Antecedent it bewrayed of falſhood; for <note place="margin">The D. to charge his Refuter with falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth a double un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth, and yet to no purpoſe.</note> if there were in the citie and countrey more distinct Churches or Pariſhes (as here is ſuppoſed) and theſe all ſubor dinate to one (as I have manifeſtly proved) then all theſe will make a Dinceſe.</hi> Behold here a double untruth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to conclude a falſhood in his Refuters Antecedent, &amp; yet all wil not ſerve the turne, when he hath done the moſt he can. For firſt, the parentheſis in the Antecedent, doth not neceſſarily ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that the townes round about every citie had diſtinct Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in them; onely it holdeth the matter in ſuſpenſe, touching ſome one or moe townes in ſome countries, becauſe (as the Doctor remembreth) Cenchreae neere unto Corinth, was a diſtinct church; and in ſuch a caſe, it excepteth ſuch townes, and annexeth to the citie church the reſt. Neyther is it true, that he hath manifeſtly
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:14068:195"/> proved the ſubordination of many Churches unto one, within the Apoſtles daynes; no nor yet within the firſt 200. yeares after Chriſt. But ſay there were a truth in both his untruthes; and graunt him alſo that which he inferreth, to wit, that many Churches ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to one, will make a Dioceſe? how doth this convince the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futers Antecedent of falſhood? Did not his paſſions blinde his judgement, when he imagined there is ſtrength enough in this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence? for thus he reaſoneth. <hi>Many Churches in citie and country ſubordinated all to one do make a Diociſe; Ergo, all the Chriſtians in a citie, and the townes adioyning, which have no diſtinct Church in them, muſt needs make more then one particular congregation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But perhaps he correcteth his owne errour, in the words fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, when he faith; <hi>I ſay therefore againe, that though their Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent were true, yet the conſequence were to be denied.</hi> The which, what is it, but to run from one errour to another? For it is before obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the concluſion which the Refuter ſlandeth here to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyn, is no other in effect then this; that the Presbyters firſt ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Apoſtles, were aſſigned (not to the overfight of many Churches) but to one onely congregation. Now if there be a truth in his Antecedent (which affirmeth that at that time, the Chriſtians in any citie and townes around it (ſuch namely as had no diſtinct Churches in them) made but one congregation:) the conſequence of the argument; cannot be infringed otherwiſe; then by ſhewing that the presbyters received from the Apoſtles, not onely the charge of that one co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; but alſo the goverme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of ſome other churches eſtabliſhed, in ſome other, eyther more populous or more remote townes. Which to demonſtrate, it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth not to aſſume this, that many churches ſubordinate to one doe make a Dioceſe; but good proofe muſt be added alſo, that this ſubordination of many Churches in countrey townes to the Church of the citie, tooke place in the time of the Apoſtles, and was ratified by their allowance.</p>
                     <p>Having thus freed the Refuters Enthymem from the Doctors <note place="margin">Sect 7.</note> frivolous exceptions, I will once againe produce it to his viewe; but in another forme, which ſhall not affright him, as the former parentheſis did, in a plaine ſyllogiſme therefore (which kinde of argument he beſt affect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:14068:195"/> ordinary congregation aſſembled togither in one place: But all thoſe Christians were the whole or proper charge, unto which the Preſbyterie with their Preſident, ſeated in any citie, was aſſigned by the Apostles. Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, the whole or proper charge unto which the Preſbyterie with their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident ſeated in the citie aſſigned by the Apostles, made but one particular ordinarie congregation, aſſembled in one place.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The concluſion is the ſame (in effect) with the conſequent of the Enthymem before delivered; and the propoſition here is the former Antecedent rightly vnderſtood, according to the explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion where of the D. taketh notice. pag 83. Onely that clauſe (of Apoſtles times) is inſerted to prevent his wandring beyond the principall queſtion, vnto the ages that followed the firſt aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Presbyters to the charge of thoſe Churches, which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles planted. And becauſe it hath very neere agreement with that Aſſumption which the D. afterwards impugneth (cap. 6. pag. 102. &amp;c.) the defenſe of that wilbe ſufficient confirmation of this. For if it may appeare (as I doubt not but it ſhall) that the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Corinth, Epheſus, and Antioch, in the Apoſtles times were each of them no more, then one particular ordinary congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation; then will it follow that the reſt of the Churches planted in cities by the Apoſtles, made alſo but one congregation, the Doct. himſelfe being Iudge, who granteth this conſequence pag. 101. At this time therefore paſſing by the propoſition, I will take in hand the Aſſumption, which comprizeth the conſequence of the former Enthymem; and unto all already ſayd for removall of the D. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, I add this one argument following;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The whole or proper charge unto which the Preſbyterie with their preſide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſeated in any city, was aſſigned by the Apostles, is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prized in thoſe instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which in the Apostolicall writings concerne the office of Biſhops and Preſbyters;</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But this onely charge is there comprized; to wit, the charge of all the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians which in thoſe times, dwelling in or about the towne or city that enjoyed ſuch a Preſbyterie, were called the Church of that place.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ergo, this onely charge, to wit, the charge of all the Chriſtians which in thoſe times dwelling in or about the Town or City that enjoyed ſuch a Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie; was the whole charge, to which the Preſbytery with their preſident ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in any city, was aſſigned by the Apoſtles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The propoſition cannot be doubted of; ſeing the Apoſtle teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:14068:196"/> the ſcripture to be ſufficient, for the direction of every Miniſter of God, and perfecting of him in the work of his calling. 2 Tim. 3. 16. 17. And th'aſſumption is evident by theſe and the like places. (Act. 20. 28. 1. Tim. 3. 1. 5. 1. Theſſ. 5. 12. Heb. 13. 7. 17) which ſhew that the perſons committed to the charge of Biſhops or Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, were none other then thoſe Chriſtians, which were mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the particular churches, wherein their labours were imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For none other but ſuch chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s can properly be vnderſtood, by the ſhock or Church of God; which they (in the 3. former pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) are charged to feed, to care for; &amp; by the perſons, which are (in the two later) comanded to know, love and obey ſuch as laboured amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp;c. And if the Doctor can yeild us any text of holy writ, that ſtretcheth the charge of Biſhops and Presbyters over an whole dioceſe or countrie, to labour the converſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of all that within ſuch a circuite belonged to Gods election, I will moſt gladly liſten to it. In the interim, to end this point, I argue with him <hi>a conceſſis,</hi> in this manner;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A viſible Church indued with power of eccleſiasticall government, was the proper and whole charge of each Preſbyterie, ordeyned by the Apostles in any citie that imbraced the Goſpell. But the company of Chriſtians which in the Apoſtles times, dwelt in and about any citie, and were called the Church of that citie was a viſible church indued with power of eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call government. Ergo ſuch a company of Christians, was the proper and whole charge, of each Preſbyterie ordeyned by the Apoſtles, in any city that imbraced the Goſpell.</hi> The propoſition is in effect, all one with that, which the ſupplieth to his Enthymem. Cap. 4. ſect 1. pag. 64; where he affirmeth, that the Presbyters ordeyned by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, were appointed to viſible Churches indued with power of ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall government. And the Aſſumption receiveth approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from that deſcription of a church in generall, and of a viſible Church in ſpeciall. cap. 1. pag. 3. 5. 6. I could make theſe points more clears, if I thought it needfull; but I hope he will rather ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to the concluſion, then ſtrive in vaine againſt the ſtreame. Wherefore I proceed to the Refuters argument urged to prove, that the viſible Churches indued by the Apoſtles with the power of ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall government, were pariſhes.</p>

The Refuters Argument there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall come forth once againe, in that plaine forme that was firſt given unto it. Onely I adde the Church of Ieruſalem to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther three, that he mentioneth, becauſe that which the Refuter urgeth touching it, is bounded alſo within the Apoſtles times, as appeareth pag. 64. of his anſwere (for which cauſe I referre the handling of his 4 6 7 8 ſect. cap. 5. concerning Ieruſalem to this place. And ſo it lieth thus;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If the Churches of Corinth, Epheſus, Antioch, and Ieruſalim (being vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible churches indued with power of eccleſiaſticall government) were each of them but one pariſh: then the other viſible Churches indued with the like pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; were alſo each of them, but one pariſh. But the firſt is true. Ergo alſo the ſecond.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To make good the conſequence of the Propoſition, he ſaid, that it ſtandeth upon the foundation which the Doctor himſelfe layd in the firſt argument; drawne from his text: neyther was he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in deceived; for in this defenſe cap. 2. ſect. 2. he confeſſeth, that he preſuppoſed all other Churches indued with power of eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall government, to be like to thoſe 7; becauſe it is not to be doubted, but the primitive Churches indued with that power, were of like nature and conſtitution. But the Doctor burieth all this in
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:14068:197"/> ſilence; and (as if the Refuter had intreated that the conſequence might paſſe without controulment) he ſeemeth vnwilling to yeild him ſo much favour vnleſſe it may be lawfull for him, to uſe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which he ſaith is like, viz. <hi>that if the Churches of Alexandria and Rome were not pariſhonall Churches in the firſt 200 yeares; (he meaneth unto the full end of that terme) then neyther were the Churches of other cities.</hi> And then telleth us, But they were not pariſhonall churches, as for Rome he had proved, and for Alexandria would prove; &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore concludeth ſo of the reſt. Well, let us reaſon a little with him; is the conſequence indeed the ſame? ſo he ſaith; but doth he ſpeak as he is perſwaded? if not, why ſetteth he ſuch a face of truth upon a lie? If yea, why inwrappeth he his owne feet in the ſnare that he layeth for another? for whether he diſclaime or allow the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and the hypotheſis, whereon it is grounded; will he nil he, he muſt beare the blame of a foule contradiction. To diſclaime it, is to overthrow (as before is noted) the foundation of his owne argument, pa. 42. To allow it, is to make way for the utter ruine of <note place="margin">A foul co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction in the D.</note> that aſſumption, which he urgeth for a double advantage, (p. 69 &amp; 122. lin. 1.) for if that may be verefied of all other Churches; which he avoucheth (here and pag. 124) for certeinty, of Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria; and elſewhere (pag 50 and 122) denieth probable in ſome others, then by the like conſequence (alike grounded on the ſame hypotheſis) we may conclude that all other Churches, indued with power of eccleſiaſticall government, were alſo divided into diverſe pariſhes, even in the Apoſtles times, deſerveth not the D. now to be beaten with his owne cudgell. pag 73. Is it credible that any man ſhould be ſo tranſported with the ſpirit of contradiction, that he ſhould not care, ſo he may gainſay his adverſaries preſent affer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; how ſhamefally he contradicteth himſelfe, yet thus it fareth with the Doctor.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding, I can eaſily free the Refuter from that diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, which the D. concluſion threatneth. For we can and wil hold our owne conſequence for a truth on both parts already aſſented to; till we heare him directly contradict the hypotheſis, whereon it is grounded (as himſelfe acknowledgeth) viz. that all churches indued with power of eccleſiaſticall government, were at the firſt of the ſame nature and conſtitution: but the later ſhall hang in ſuſpence, till he hath proved, that it is grounded on the ſame hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis. For in our apprehenſion, his conſequence preſuppoſeth,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:14068:197"/> that all Churches were alike (not in that nature and conſtitution, wherein they ſtood at the firſt, but) in this alteration, wherein A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria &amp; Rome went before others; namely to be diſtinguiſhed into many pariſhes, whereas all, at their firſt planting, were vndi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed as himſelfe confeſſeth.</p>
                     <p>To paſſe therefore forwards to the Aſſumption; becauſe the <note place="margin"> Sect. 2. ad ſect. 2. pag. 102.</note> Refuter ſaith, <hi>it appeareth plaine by the proofe of the particulars.</hi> Mr. D. aſketh, <hi>whether his ſyll<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <item>The Churches of Corinth, Epheſus, Antioch and Ieruſalem, were each of them in the Apoſtle Pauls time, no more then ordinarily aſsembled in one place.</item>
                        <item>Therefore, they were each of them, at that time but one pariſh.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>But the Doctor having wronged his Refuter before, by ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his aſſumption beyond the age of the Apoſtles, to the full term of 200 yeares; holdeth on and doubleth the wrong, by reteyning the ſame addition of 200. yeares; that he might have the more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour to cavill with the conſequence of the argument; &amp; to charge his Refuter with <hi>playing the Sophister,</hi> in taking that for graunted, which he did not ſo much as dreame of; viz. that each of thoſe Churches continued one congregation; and ſo one pariſh, for 200. yeares, becauſe they were but one congregation in the Apoſtles times. Wherefore, what he objecteth to infringe this conſequence, I overpaſſe as unworthy the anſwer, ſeing he forged it for the nonce to cavill with. True it is, that the conſequence of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toymem before ſet down preſuppoſeth a truth in this aſſertio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; ſcz. that thoſe Churches are pariſhes whoſe people are no more, then ſuch as ordinarily aſſemble in one place. And the Refuter deemed it a vame of time and labour, (yea meere folly to call into queſtion that which was of the Doctor aſſented unto, (ſerm. p. 4) viz. that (when we affirme and he denieth every viſible Church to be properly a pariſh) by a pariſh is meant a particular ordinary co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:14068:198"/> of Chriſtians aſſembling in one place to the ſolemne ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God. Wherefore in denying nowe the conſequence of the argument before delivered, what elſe doth he, but play the wran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gler? For he that meaneth truely, to bring the matter controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the right iſſue, will never offer to gainſay, what is certaine and confeſſed. And becauſe he ſaith, that <hi>the reaſons of his deniall, are ſet downe at large, cap. 3. ſect. 5. &amp; 6.</hi> I muſt tell him that I finde nothing there, that directly controuleth the hypotheſis of our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence here; to wit, that every Church which maketh but one ordinarie congregation is a pariſh. And whatſoever is there ſayd touching the point then in hand, it is ſufficiently (to uſe his owne words) overthrown already. Wherfore, let us hear thoſe 2. Reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, which <hi>for a ſurpluſſage</hi> (as he ſaith) he now addeth; The firſt is this.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If theſe Churches becauſe they were each of them one congregation, were pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes, <note place="margin">Sect. 3. ad pag. 103.</note> before the diviſion of pariſhes; then they were ſuch Churches, as after the diviſion, pariſhes were. But they were not ſuch Churches.</hi> (I will adde the concluſion) <hi>Ergo, neyther were they pariſhes, before the diviſion of Pariſhes; becauſe they were each of them one congregation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First, I praye the Doctor to tell us, what moveth him to tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble into the concluſion, and conſequent of the propoſition this clauſe; <hi>before the diviſion of pariſhes</hi>? Where hath his Refuter ſayed, that thoſe Churches of Corinth, Epheſus &amp;c. were pariſhes before the diviſion of pariſhes? or why doth he father on him ſuch a ſenſleſſe aſſertion, as this is? For in his owne underſtanding, it is all one, as if a man ſhould ſay, <hi>that thoſe Churches were pariſhes, before they were any pariſhes at all;</hi> as appeareth by his deſcanting upon this point, pag. 69. and 70. But let us ſee how the Doctor fortifyeth each part of his argumentation. First touching his aſſumption to prove that thoſe churches were not ſuch, as were the pariſhes that follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed the diviſion, he urgeth 3. differences betwixt the one and the other. 1. pariſhes after their diviſion, had not a Biſhop and a Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterie (as thoſe Churches had) but onely one preshyter aſſigned to them. 2. the Paſtor of the Pariſhes was not a Superintendent, (as was the Biſhop of thoſe Churches) over other Paſtors. 3. nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was any of them intended (as each of thoſe Churches was) to be a Mother-church. Theſe differences being nakedly affirmed, <note place="margin">The Doct. argueth like a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſter.</note> may with a bare deniall be repelled; but the anſwere at this time ſhalbe rather this; that he playeth the Sophiſter in arguing <hi>a dicto ſecundum quid, ad ſimpliciter.</hi> For ſay that he could (as he cannot)
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:14068:198"/> mainteyne theſe differences; thoſe Churches might be (yea were) notwithſtanding, ſuch churches as the pariſhes were after the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion: that is, alike in the point, which himſelfe taketh notice of (pag. 4. of his ſermon) as the ſubſtanciall point of the agreement intended; the former being aſwell as the later, each of them, one ordinary congregation aſſembled in one place. But if his meaning be, <hi>that they were not ſuch in all points;</hi> we may well demurre upon the matter, till the queſtion be debated (which belongeth to another tract) what manner of pariſhes they were, which received their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall, from the diviſion of one citie Church into many pariſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſemblies. In the meane time, to come to the conſequence of his propoſition, whereas he ſaith, <hi>it may not be denied, specially by them, that would have all pariſhes framed to the constitution of the first Churches;</hi> I wilbe ſo bolde as utterly to contradict this ſpeach, and ſay the contrary to it, that it may very well be denyed even by ſuch as would have the pariſhes ſo framed. For in as much as they deſire, not the aboliſhing of pariſhes, but the reducing of them to the patterne of the firſt churches, it is evident, that they in their judgment hold two kindes of pariſhes; the one differing from, the other agreeing with the forme and conſtitution of the firſt Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. And whoſoever will in any ſort undertake the defenſe of that concluſion, which the Doctors argument throweth upon his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futer, he muſt needs diſtinguiſh in ſome reſpect or other, betwixt the pariſhes that had their being before, and thoſe that began af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that diviſion of pariſhes, whereof he ſpeaketh; and therefore muſt of neceſſitie contradict the Doctors conſequence, &amp; ſay, that the firſt Churches, which were pariſhes (in aſmuch as they were but one congregation) before that diviſion of pariſhes, which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed (when thoſe Churches by reaſon of their multitude, hugely increaſed, were parted into more particular congregations;) were not in all points ſuch Churches as the later pariſhes were.</p>
                     <p>Thus is the ſtroake of his firſt reaſon warded; let me come now <note place="margin">Sect. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>
                        </note> to encounter with the ſecond. If ſaith he, <hi>that aſſumption was falſe, which denied Pariſhes to have been distinguiſhed in the Apoſtles times; then theſe Churches were not onely many congregations, but many pariſhes alſo. But the Refuter ſayd before that that aſsumption had no truth in it.</hi> (here alſo muſt I adde the concluſion) Ergo, thoſe Churches were, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly many congregations but alſo many pariſhes. Vnderſtand this to be meant of each Church ſeverally, q. d. Ergo each of them was
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:14068:199"/> not one onely congregation or pariſh, but many. And marke what followeth. <hi>Theſe two juſt exceptions</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I have against his conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</hi> So you may diſcerne how juſt cauſe he giveth me, to take up againſt him, his owne faſhion of reply, pag. 72. Good Sir, what is this to the Refuters conſequence? Where doth he ſay, that each of theſe Churches was but one congregation, and not many? and where, that each was but one pariſh? Is not the former his Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent or aſſumption, and the later the conſequent or concluſion? Therefore (to uſe his owne words, pag. 73.) when you would <hi>ſeeme to deny the conſequence, you do not ſo much as touch it; but by taking a ſuppoſed advantage</hi> againſt ſome other aſſertion of his; you deny <hi>the principall concluſion.</hi> I might proceed therefore to rowſe him up, with the ſweet ſound of his owne b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If the Doct. ſhall (eyther here, or in the for his defenſe, that theſe ſpeaches may be fitly applyed (though in a differing ſenſe) to ſuch purpoſe as he affirmeth; it may be replyed, that if he confeſſe the ſenſe to be differing, he diſcovereth his anſwer to be deceitfull; but it is falſe and abſurd, if the conſtruction of the words be one &amp; the ſame. As for that which he addeth touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the word <hi>flock</hi> that it may be extended to a nationall, provinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all or dioceſan Church, what meaneth he ſtill to preſume, that his bare word will be taken for currant payment? I confeſſe, it is ſometimes put for the vniverſall Church (as Iohn 10. 16.) but he can alleadge no place in all the Apoſtolical writings, where it is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to any viſible church, that comprized in her circuite many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct congregations. Wherefore he can with no ſhew of reaſon contradict his Refuter in affirming it to be a new conceite (&amp; void of reaſon) to imagine that the church of Epheſus was a Dioceſan flock conſiſting of many congregations. Moreover how can we in the interpretation of the ſcripture, admit any word, whoſe ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification is queſtioned to be extended vnto a thing, which at that time had none exiſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in rerum natura? or how can he affirm without contradiction to the truth (elſwhere acknowledged) that the Church of Epheſus was a nationall or provinciall Church? for provinciall Churches grew up by the combinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of many Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, vnder one Metropolitan Biſhop, (as himſelfe affirmeth lib. 3. pag. 21) but as yet Epheſus had no Biſhop at all, if that be true which he mainteyneth touching Timothy their Biſhop, in his account; (ſerm pag. 79. and 80. and Def. lib. 4. pag. 90.) viz. that he was not ordeyned Biſhop, till after Pauls deliverance from his impriſonment at Rome. And if the reſt of the churches which were then in Aſia (1. Cor. 16. 19.) ſtood in any ſubordination to Epheſus, as the Mother-Church of the whole nation; why ſhould not Epheſus have ſome note of principality given vnto it, above the reſt of the 7.

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:14068:202"/> word <hi>polupletheia,</hi> which Ignatiu uſeth (as the D. imagineth) of purpoſe to note, that the Church conſiſted of many multitudes or congregations; it is but a weak conjecture, unworthy to come fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Doctor for <hi>popupletheia</hi> is nothing elſe, but <hi>polu plethos</hi> a great multitude; and therefore argueth not many congregations, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one great aſſembly. But goe we forwardes; whereas Ignatius calleth the Church at Antioch <hi>ſunagogen,</hi> a Synagogue, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly noteth one congregation; as ritch as he is, he hath no other anſwer to give us, but <hi>that it is uſed in the ſame ſignification with eccleſia,</hi> which argueth his povertie, in aſmuch as he doth therin againe but begge the queſtion. Yea, but he hath another ſhift wherein he much glorieth, viz. that Ignatius entitleth himſelf <hi>the Biſhop of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria. epiſt.</hi> ad Magneſ. &amp; Rom. &amp; as if he had ſtrook it dead, willeth his adverſarie to tell him, <hi>what manner of pariſh Syrsa was;</hi> and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that <hi>may heare alſo what he can object</hi> againſt the two epiſtles; and ſo giveth all the grace he can to them, cloſing all up &amp; ſaying, that <hi>he leaueth that moſt pregnunt &amp; authentique euidence of Ignatius to his aduerſary to muſe upon.</hi> See you not how bragge he would ſeeme to be, as if he had gotten a great conqueſt? yet what is this to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent queſtion? will he thus argue? The Chriſtians throughout Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria in the time of Ignatius (who calleth himſelfe the Biſhop of Sy-ria) made many Churches or congregations. Ergo the Church of Antioch (where of he had more properly the charge) was more then one congregation. Can there come a worſe inconſequence from one that is but a ſmatterer in ſchoole diſputations?</p>
                     <p>Thus are wee come to the teſtimonyes of the new writers. viz. Tindall, Bale, Fulk, Perkins; Our great Church-Bible, and D. Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. <note place="margin">Sect. 9. ad pag. 106. &amp; 107.</note> 
                        <hi>All which,</hi> the Doctor ſaith <hi>(excepting two testimonies of Tindall) the Refuter moſt childiſhly alleadgeth.</hi> But what if his exceptions be more childiſh, then his Refuters allegations? let us compare them; and leave the cenſure of both, to the indifferent reader. It is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected that the ancient tranſlators of the new teſtament into the engliſh tongue, doe turoe the word, <hi>eccleſia, congregation;</hi> when they ſpeak of the Church of Epheſus, and the reſt in the Revelation: and to the ſame purpoſe are the reſt (but Doct. Bilſon) alleadged). And that tranſlation is juſtified not onely by Mr Tindall Thomas More, but by Iohn Bale ſometimes a Biſhop, in his expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the word Churches and Candleſticks, by D. Fulk againſt the Rhemiſts aunot, in Ephel. 5. and by Mr Perkins in his expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:14068:202"/> of Apoc. 2. &amp; 3. affirming that the 7. Churches were parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular congregations. And D. Bilſon againſt the Seminaries affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that the word is never taken in the new teſtament for the Preiſts alone; but for the congregation of the faithfull, and name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that it is ſo taken Act. 20, 28. Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which allegations it is inferred, that therefore in their judgement, the Church of Epheſus, &amp; other like chutches in cities; were each of them but one particular co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and did not conſiſt of many. Now is not this inference grounded on good probabilitie? for can it be imagined that theſe learned &amp; worthy men would have ſo interpreted the word <hi>eccleſie,</hi> by <hi>congregation,</hi> if they had not been perſwaded, that moſt natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it expreſſed the meaning thereof? And if ſo; muſt not each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church, be, in their judgement one particular congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? If the Papiſts could prove any one of the 7. Churches of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, to haue conſiſted of many diſtinct congregations: were it not a more juſt exception, then any they haue alleadged, to weaken their interpretation; ſeing a multitude diſtinguiſhed into many congregations, cannot properly be called one congregation? But let us heare the Doctors exceptions. Firſt he telleth us, that the ancient engliſh Bibles, <hi>doe uſe the word congregation, not onely where mention is made of particular Churches, but of the univerſall Church alſo,</hi> as Mat. 16 18. Epheſ. 1. 22. &amp; 5. 25. even ſo; and we know it well; and eſteeme the reaſon to be alike; for as particular Churches are each of them one viſible congregation, and not many: ſo is the Church univerſall, one inviſible congregation; the former gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red togither into one aſſembly; open to the eyes of men at one time and in one place; the other gathered togither into one myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call body, which (though hidden from men in this world, yet) is <hi>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>no nituitu</hi> manifeſt unto God, and at the laſt day, ſhalbe actually congregated into one aſſembly in the viewe of men and angels. Secondly the Doctor layeth downe <hi>the reaſons mouing the firſt tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the Bible into Engliſh, to avoyd the name Church and in ſtead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to uſe the word congregation. 1. Becauſe CHURCH more properly ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the place of meeting, then the congregation it ſelf, which is meant by eccleſia. 2. Becauſe the Papiſts had abuſed it, to ſignify, eyther generally the romiſh Church, or particularly to import the romiſh Clergie.</hi> And I wiſh the reader to conſider, whether this firſt reaſon doth not juſtify the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futers affirmation, viz. that in the judgement of thoſe Tranſlators ECCLESIA doth properly note ſuch a congregation as is gathered
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:14068:203"/> togither in one place, &amp; whither the ſecond doth any way infringe it?</p>
                     <p>Thirdly concerning the teſtimony of D. Fulk; the Doctor ſaith, <note place="margin">Sect. 10. ad pag. 107.</note> 
                        <hi>the allegation thereof, ſheweth extreame want, eyther of indgement or benef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:</hi> but I perſwade my ſelfe, the want eyther of the one or other, will more justly fall upon the Accuſer, then the Refut: when things are indifferently weighed on both ſides. For wherein hath he fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led? Is it not true which he ſaith, that <hi>D. Fulkinstifieth the tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of eceleſia by congregation, as better expreſſing the Greek</hi> then the word Church? &amp; doth not this argue plainely, that he heild the Church of Epheſus (and all other Churches in cities) to conſiſt but of one particular congregation? In deed, if his defenſe of our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, tranſlating <hi>eccleſia</hi> by <hi>congregation,</hi> had been limited onely to that text Epheſ. 5. 23. (as Mr Doctor indeavoureth to perſwade) the Refuter had ſhewed litle diſcretion, in the choiſe of that reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, to argue that which he inferreth: but as the Rhemiſts (in their annot. on that text) taxe our firſt engliſh Bibles with corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption (not for miſtranſlating the word in that place onely, but generally) for not uſing ſo much at once in all the Bible, the name of Church, but in ſtead thereof, <hi>congregation:</hi> ſo D. Fulks anſwer is ſitted in generall to juſtify the Tranſlators in ſo doing. <hi>They ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſed</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the word Congregation then Church to avoyd ambigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; becauſe this word Church is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly taken for the howſe of the aſſembly of Christians; and that the people might know that the Church is a gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing togither, of all the members into one body, which in the name of church doth not appeare.</hi> Is it not plaine that in his underſtanding, the word <hi>ecckſia</hi> ſignifieth properly, ſuch an aſſembly of Chriſtians as is ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered togither into one body, in one houſe or place, ſuch as co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly we call a Church? See I pray, how he interpreteth himſelfe in his anſwere to Gregory Martin Pref. ſect. 51. pag. 92. and cap. 5. ſect. 5. pag 148. Wherefore, though he ſpeak never a word of the Church of Epheſus in ſpeciall, yet his defenſe of the tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in generall, doth not onely juſtify them in calling the Church in Epheſus, the Congregation in Epheſus; but alſo argue by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that the Church there conſiſted at that time, (not of many ſeverall congregations, but) of one particular Church-aſſembly onely. Wherefore, the Doctor mought with more judgement &amp; honeſty have ſet a leſſe face upon it, then to charge his Refut: with want of eyther, for alleadging his teſtimony.
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:14068:203"/> Fourthly, as touching the teſtimony of Mr. Perkins, the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference alſo clearely ariſeth from his aſſertion, viz. that the 7. chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches were particular congregations. For he would never have ſo ſaid vnleſſe he thought each of them to be one particular congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation; ſeing it were abſurd to entitle any Church, a particular co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, which is knowne to conſift of many particulars. And for the ſame cauſe, who can with reaſon judge otherwiſe, then that D. Bilſon alſo took the Church of Epheſus to be one congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, when he alleadgeth Act. 20. 28. to ſhew, that the Church in the new Teſtament, is put for the congregation of the faithfull, &amp; not for the Preiſts alone. Wherefore whereas the D. in the concluſion renueth his challenge, that <hi>our new writers are childiſhly alleadged;</hi> what elſe doth he, but ſhew himſelfe to be ſet to outface all? The which the more appeareth by that his taxe layd upon his Refuter for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadging Mr Tindall which (as he ſaith) was <hi>not a childiſh mistake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but a wilfull miſalleadging of him in both places, there being in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, no ſuch thing;</hi> and in the later <hi>a falſifying of the testimony;</hi> and to aggrevate the offence, chargeth it upon him as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted againe. lib. 4. cap. 7. ſect. 9. But if any fault be here co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted (ſave the miſtaking of pag. 135. for 133.) it is in the Doctor, who mought alſo have amended that miſtaking; ſeing he could not but ſee it, when he patched up his owne allegation out of both thoſe pages; but it ſeemeth he had rather make two faults then mend one. And that it may appeare how he falſely accuſeth his Retuter; let the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conſider, that as the words ſet downe by him are not Mr Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals words at large; but a breife of them; ſo they are a true breife of them. For proofe whereof it is cleare, 1. that he maketh <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Preiſts and Elders</hi> all one, pag. 53. 54. 251. 345. 2. He ſaith that by their office, <hi>they were alwayes abiding in one place to governe the Congregation there.</hi> pag. 251. And 3. (however the Doctor ſaith, he maketh the word CONGREGATION <hi>as large as the word ECCLE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ST A CHURCH,</hi> yet he maketh the word <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Congregation,</hi> whereof a Biſhop, Preiſt, or Elder had the charge, no larger, then one particular co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany aſſembling in one place as appeareth both by his expoſition of Math. 18. 17. (pag. 345.) and by his words at large (which the D. could not but (though he would not) ſee, when he overskipped them) pag. 133. where ſpeaking of the 2. of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers ordeyned by the Apoſtles for the governing of the Church; he ſaith. <hi>The Apostles diſguished no man, but choſe men annoy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ted with the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:14068:204"/> ſame spirit (viz. wherewith Christ annointed them) one to preach the word, whom We call after the Greek tongue, a Biſhop or Prust, that is, in English, an overſeer, or an Elder; how he was annointed thou readeſt 1. Tim. 3. &amp;c. This Overſeer becanſe he was taken from his own buſiness &amp; labour to preach Gods word to the pariſh, bath right by the autboritie of his office, to challendge an honest living of the pariſh, &amp;c. Likewiſe in every congregation, choſe they another after the ſame enſample, as is to be ſeene Act. 6. whom after the gr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word we call Deason, that is in Engliſh, ſervant or Miniſter, whoſe office was to help and aſſist the Preist, to gather up his duty, and to gather for the poore &amp;c.</hi> But of Mr Tindalls judgement and words we ſhall heare more at large when we come to that place, where he ſaith his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futer falſifyeth his teſtimony againe; in the meane time, let the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der judge with what face the Doctor ſo charged his Refuter.</p>
                     <p>Thus much ſhall ſuffice to ſhewe, how the Doctor ſought but ſtartingholes, in all his exceptions againſt the refuters teſtimonies. For when he hath done wrangling with all his proofes, he return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to his deniall of the conſequence (pag. 111.) viz. that though it were graunted, that each of the Churches for a time did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed for their number the proportion of one ordinarie congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet it would not prove them to haue been pariſhes. As if he could deny them, to be each of them one pariſh (that is, one co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>-gregation) &amp; yet graunt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be one onely ordinary congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
                     <p>Having done with thoſe 3. Churches of Corinth Epheſus &amp; An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch; <note place="margin">Sect. 11. ad cap. 5. ſect. 8. pa. 89.</note> we are to proceed to that which the D. anſwereth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the Church of Ieruſalem; viz. to the aſſumption of that ſyllogiſma which affirmeth (Cap. 5. ſect. 8. pag. 89.) the Chriſtians of leru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem to have co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued one aſſembly meeting togither in one place (during S. Lukes ſtorie) Act. 2. 1. 2. 6. 44. and 6. 2. and 15. 22. 25. and 21. 22. <hi>This</hi> (ſaith the D) <hi>is falſe, becauſe the Church of Ieruſalem never was a pariſh ſo farre was it from continuing ſo ſtill &amp;c.</hi> and the D. dwelleth wholly in a maner upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this anſwer; but the Reader is to be advertiſed, that he doth but trifle &amp; quarrell with words, rather then impugne the maine point of the argument, for when the Refuter affirmeth that the Chriſtians at leruſalem continued one pariſhonall aſſembly, meeting togither in one place; the later claſe is the explication, or rather confirmation of the former. q. d. they continued one pariſh-aſſembly, in aſmuch as they met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither in one place. Wherefore the principall queſtion here for Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſalem, (like as before for the 3. above named Churches) is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:14068:204"/> the Chriſtians there might &amp; did meet togither, in one place? to this purpoſe thoſe places out of the Acts are quoted, and if the D. can make the contrary appeare, his labour is well ſpent, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he doth but beat the aier. <hi>It is not probable</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that the Church of Ieruſate afeer they came to the number of 5000. did ordinarily meet all in one place.</hi> Belike he holdeth it probable, that before they aroſe to that number they did ordinarily meet togither in one place; ſo that when he ſtriveth to wreſt from his Refuter the places alleadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of Act. 2. he doth here (as before is obſerved ſect. 5.) rather quarrell with his proofes, then contradict the thing thence col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected. But let us take the particulars of the thing as they lye in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. <hi>Wee read</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of ſome Panegyricall meetings, as it were in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons porch and in the temple, ſuch as be the meetings at Pauls croſſe and at the Sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>tle; but their ordinary and as it were pariſhonall meetings, were by companies in more private places.</hi> It is true, wee read of diverſe mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, ſome in more private houſes (as Act. 2. 1. 2. 46. and 4. 31. &amp; 5. 42.) and ſome in more publique places (as the Temple Act. 2. 46. &amp; 5. 12. 42.) but that one were Panegyricall and the other Pariſhonall (whether ſimply, or as it were) I for my part never read authour, that hath gone before the Doctor in this diſtinction; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth he yeeld us any ſhredd of probabilitie to grace his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion. The maine point now ſtood for (viz. that the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans at Ieruſalem were but one ordinarie aſſembly, gathered into one place) is apparant enough by the ſcriptures before quoted; though in the Doctors eyes they ſeeme to be eyther <hi>ignorantly or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdly alleadged.</hi> For however the two firſt verſes of Act. 2. are by ſome learned Interpreters reſtreyned to the 12. Apoſtles, becauſe they think the promiſe of the holy Ghoſt belonged to them alone. cap. 1. 4. 5. yet are there others alſo of good account, that holde it no abſurditie to think, that the reſt of the diſciples (which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied the Apoſtles, cap 1. 14. 15.) were pareakers with them of the holy Ghoſt; becauſe it ſuiteth well with Ioels propheſye, ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by Peter, (cap. 2. 17. 18.) and with that riches of Gods grace, manifeſted in many others afterwards, cap. 8. 17. &amp; 10. 45. 46. &amp; 19 6.

To conclude therefore, ſeing it is evident by the wordes of S. Lokes ſtorie, that all the beleevers which belonged to the Church at Ieruſalem in that time were aſſembled togither in one place from time to time as occaſion ſerved; it is ſufficiently proved (all the Doctors cavils not with ſtanding) that they did not for their number exceed the proportion of one ordinary congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation; and conſequently (as the reſt of the Churches before ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, ſo) this was rather a pariſh aſſembly, then a dioceſan church like to one of ours.</p>
                     <p>As for the Doctors exceptions ſect. 6. pag. 87. (viz. that the <note place="margin">Sect. 14. ad ſect. 6. pag. 87.</note> Church of Ieruſalem was never intended to be one pariſh among many, but a mother Church to beget others, which were to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from it, and yet to remaine ſubject to it; and that it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that all the Chriſtians both in citie and country ſhould be under the Biſhop of Ieruſalem like as the people of citie and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try were all under one high-preiſt) me thinkes that reader is ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſtrongly conceited of the Doctor, that will enterteyne theſe points, upon his owne meere conjecture and bare word. For how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is cleare, that many Churches drew their originall from Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, and received the faith by their Miniſterie, which had bene for a time members of that Church (Act. 8. 1. 4. 5. 44. &amp; 9. 19.
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:14068:206"/> 22.) yet is there not the leaſt inkling of the leaſt ſubjection, that any of thoſe daughter churches, yeelded to Ieruſalem, or the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterie there eſtabliſhed. And therefore the intention which he dreameth of (concerning the ſubjection of all Chriſtians in City and Country to the Biſhop of Ieruſalem, like as all the Iewes were anciently under the high. preiſt) hath neyther foundation in the holy ſcriptures; nor can he gather it from the practiſe of ſucceding ages; ſeing their advancing of the Church of Ceſarea to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of a Metropolitance Church, ſuperiour in juriſdiction to Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem; argueth that they were altogither ignorant of it. For, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the many and great thoughts of the Doctors heart, can this enter into it, that they would wittingly depart from that order, which was inſtituted or intended by the Apoſtles, to follow the which was inſtituted or intended the Apoſtles, to follow the courſe of that preheminence, which the Romane Emperors (that were enemies to Chriſt and his truth) ſhould eſtabliſh in their poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall government? But what need many wordes in a plaine matter? This is enough for reſuting ſo frivolous a fancie, as hath no force of any ſound reaſon to confirm it. Thus have we ſeene how well the Doctor hath proved that the Churches founded by the Apoſtles were Dioceſes properly, like to ours; and not pariſhes. It now followeth in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond book, that we examine his proofes for his Dioceſan Biſhops.</p>

For he taketh it for an vndoubted truth, (ſerm. pag. 92.) that what the Apoſtles did in the execution of their Apoſtolicall function, they did by the direction of the holy Ghoſt; and therefore he holdeth their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances to be divine, as having God for their authour. So then in affirming it to be therfore divine, becauſe it is Apoſtolicall, we take
<pb facs="tcp:14068:208"/> his meaning to be this; that this function was firſt inſtituted (not by Chriſt or God immediately, but) by the Apoſtles, as the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate authors; and therefore is not otherwiſe divine, then me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately and by conſequence, as all other Apoſtolical ordinances &amp; actions are. And this to be his meaning, his owne words declare (ſerm. pag. 92. in the margin) when he ſaith, <hi>that in this ſenſe &amp; no other, he holdeth the epiſcopall function to be a divine ordinance, to wit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe what was ordeyned by the Apostles, the ſame proceeded from God.</hi> But then, what may wee think his meaning to be, in his ſecond ſort of proofes, which muſt conclude directly (and not by conſequence as before) that the epiſcopall function is of divine inſtitution?

Now if his later ſort of arguments breifly truſſed togither (ſerm. pag. 92. &amp; 93.) doe bend unto this concluſion; then are his forces like to the troupes of the Midianites, who (Iudg. 7. 22.) ſet their ſwords e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <note place="margin">A contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in the D. ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</note> one againſt his fellow throughtout the hoſt, for this conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion cutteth the throat of the former; and the former pearceth through the hart of the later; it being no more poſſible, for one and the ſame function, to have his firſt inſtitution from God, both immediately by his Apoſtles and immediately by himſelfe; then it is for one living creature to be both a man and a beaſt; or for one and the ſame ſoul, to have her originall both by mediate derivati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and by divine infuſion.

<pb facs="tcp:14068:209"/> was their director in the inſtitution thereof; or rather whereas the former principally laboureth to prove, that the Apoſtles did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute the function; taking it for granted, that in the inſtitution thereof they were led by divine direction; the later propoſeth to be proved, that which before was taken for granted; ſo that his two kindes of proofes, do all come to one generall argument, the former to juſtify the Aſſumption; and the later, the conſequence or propoſition, yet if the maine point be well weighed, which the later rank of arguments doth conclude; (viz. that Biſhops were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned of God) it will appeare that his direct proofes (ſo called) do fetch as large a compaſſe, as the former; and doe in deed, (not directly but) by conſequence onely prove, the epiſcopall function to be of divine inſtitution. Wherefore, to bleare the eyes of his reader, that he might not ſee how indirect his direct proofes are; he promiſeth (ſerm. pag. 92.) directly to prove that the epiſcopal function is of divine inſtitution; or, that Biſhops were ordeyned of God; as if the later were all one with the former.</p>

And therefore (were it not that the D. is often found to forget himſelf) I ſhould wonder, why he now vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to prove, that the function or government of Biſhops, was inſtituted by the Apoſtles, ſeing in his former book (pag. 32.) he ſaith, that diverſe ancient and approved Fathers teache, <hi>that theſe two degrees of Miniſters</hi> (viz. Biſhops and presbyters) <hi>were ordeyned by Christ;</hi> &amp; therefore inferreth, <hi>that it cannot be denied but that the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and ſuperioritie of Biſhops is of Chriſtes owne inſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> If it cannot be <note place="margin">A contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</note>

For if it were Chriſtes owne inſtitution, as the Fathers (if we may beleeve the Doctor) doe teache; then it cannot be an Apoſtolicall inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as he now very confidently averreth. And becauſe he brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth (lib. 3. pag. 24.) that he hath with ſuch evidence demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the <hi>Biſhops</hi> (diſcribed in his firſt aſſertion) <hi>are of Apostolicall institution,</hi> that he is <hi>well aſſured,</hi> that his Refuter with <hi>all his parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>To impugne the propoſition were to labour to quench the light of reaſon; and if the Doctor contradict the Aſſumption; he muſt not onely eate up his owne words before ſet downe; but alſo oppoſe himſelf againſt the judgment of the beſt approved Fathers, who (as himſelf teſtifieth) have taught the contrary; and then the ſtroke of his owne tongue, (which he whett as a ſharp raſor againſt his Refuter,) will recoile into his owne ſides in this manner. Doe the Fathers reſtify with one conſent, that theſe two degrees of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters (Biſhops and Preſbyters) were inſtituted of Chriſt; and hath the Doctor the forhead to denie it? In a matter of fact (as this is, whether Biſhops were firſt inſtituted by Chriſt himſelf, or by his Apoſtles) for any man to denie creditt to all antiquity; it is a plaine evidence, that he is addicted to noveltie and ſingularitie, the Doct. himſelf being judge, for they are his owne wordes lib. 3. pag. 23. Againe, in a matter of fact, the authoritie and teſtimonie of ſome one Father, ought to overweigh the whole nation of diſciplinaria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s (as the Doctor ſaith, but let it here be Epiſcopalians or Byſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings) contradicting the ſame. I could here give him a large handful of theſe kinde of flowers gathered out of his own garden, but I will ſpare both him and them; ſeing I am to attend upon thoſe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which he hath produced to prove his epiſcopall function
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:14068:210"/> and government, to be of Apoſtolicall inſtitution.</p>
                     <p>The firſt argueth that function to be Apoſtolicall, becauſe it was generally and perpetually uſed, in the firſt 300 yeares after Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles, &amp; was not ordeyned by generall councells; which argument ſince it altogither balketh the whole book of God, and is fitted onely, to make ſome uſe of his extravagant learning, and great reading in the Councells &amp; Fathers, &amp; of his long digreſſion in his former treatiſes, to another queſtion: I ſhall doe him no wrong to paſſe by it, for the preſent, and referr the examination both of it and the teſtimonies therein vnto a fitter tyme: for the queſtion is not, how long Biſhops have had the poſſeſſion, of that ſuperiority and government, which now they reteine; but by what authority and warrant (of God or man) they were firſt ſeaſed of it: and there is good cauſe to ſuſpect their title to be naught; when their defendants (not being able to bring forth any authenticall evidence, ſigned &amp; ſealed by the hands of the Apoſtles from whom they pretend to derive theire tenure) doe laye the weight of their cauſe, eyther upon preſcription of long continuance; or upon the teſtimony of Fathers, that lived for the moſte parte, 2. or 3. hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares after the thing was or ſhould be done, which they ſtand forth to reſtify. Eſpecially ſeing the true records of all ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, delivered by the Apoſtles unto the Churches of Chriſt, are neyther periſhed nor locked up in any private Cloyſters or cloſets; but communicated to the publick viewe of all men, who lift to ſearch what forme of government they preſcribed.</p>

                     </list>
                     <p>The propoſition in both theſe Arguments is one and the ſame, and it is juſtified by theſe Apoſtolicall precepts. 1. Theſ. 5. 21. Phil. 4. 8. &amp; 3. Ioh. 11. which allowe the Churches of Chriſt to reteyn any good thing; and deny them the uſe of nothing but what is evill.</p>
                     <p>The former aſſumption is grounded upon the Doctors allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Presbyterian diſcipline, when he affirmeth it (ſerm. pag. 95. &amp; 97. to be good as ſilver, and next to the beſt, though he deny it to be of Apoſtolicall inſtitution. And the later aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the concluſion, of his anſwere before ſet downe: wherefore he cannot with any equity withdraw his aſſent from any of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions of theſe arguments, how ſoever the former concluſion is contradictory to the aſſumption of the later; and the later conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion directly contradicteth the aſſumption of the former argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>Thus the reader may ſee that whiles the Doctor laboureth to <note place="margin">A dubble contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Doctor.</note> winde out of one contradiction, he ſticketh faſt inſnared in two for fayling. Neither let him think here to evade (as before) by ſaying that he affirmed not ſimple, the preſbyterian diſcipline to be good, but only then, when the epiſcopall government cannot be had: for Mr. Doctor were ſimple, if he could perſwade himſelf, that ſo ſlight an anſwere might free the reformed Churches that want Byſhops, from the obloquies of caviling papiſtes; which he profeſſeth to be his charitable intent, in pleading (ſo as he did) for them and their diſcipline. And ſince ſilver is ſimply good, and at all times good,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:14068:211"/> though inferior in goodnes, to golde, he dealt deceitfully &amp; not ſimply or ſyncerely, with his reader (in comparing theſe. 2 kindes of governments, for their goodnes vnto ſilver and golde:) if he meant not to allowe, the presbyterian government any other or lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger goodnes, then for thoſe times or places, where the epiſcopall regiment cannot be had.</p>
                     <p>But to look back once againe to the Doctors anſwere before ſet downe; what if I ſhould contradict his aſſumption, and make uſe of his propoſition, to cut in ſunder the windepipe of his conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in this manner'</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Where that government which the Apostles ordeyned cannot be had, there ſome other government might be admitted.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>

                        <hi>Ergo, whiles they lived, in ſome Churches, an other forme of government might be admitted.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The propoſition I am ſure he will acknowledge for his owne. Th'aſſumption is fitted (indeed) to contradict his, in the ſenſe that he imbraceth, vnderſtanding, <hi>by the government ordeyned by the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, the government by Byſhops;</hi> ſo that, whereas he ſaith, it might be had whiles the Apoſtles lived, I on the contratie affirme, that in ſome Churches at that time it could not be had. And this (I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) will be made good by his owne words elſwhere (ſerm p. 69. <note place="margin">The D. contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</note> Def. lib. 4. pag. 62.) when he alledgeth the want of ſit choiſe for one reaſon; why all other Churches beſides that of Ieruſalem wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Biſhops, for many yeares in the life tyme of the Apoſtles. For how could Biſhops be had to governe every Church, when there was not ſit choiſe of perſons fit for that function? The ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is more plainly delivered, by others that plead the ſame cauſe. Biſhop Barloe (ſerm. on Acts. 20. 28. fol. 6.) ſaith, that after the converſion of many people, even in ſetled Churches, the <hi>Apoſtles hasted not, to place a Biſhop,</hi> becauſe <hi>a preſbyter fu to be made a Biſhop is hardly found.</hi> which the Doctor alſo acknowledgeth (ſerm: pag. 54.) where he ſaith. <hi>If a worthy Miniſter be amonge men, as one of a 1000, (as Elihu spukith, Iob. 33. 23) vndoubtedly a worthy Byſhop is as one of a millio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> verie hardly therefore will he eſcape the bryars of another palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble contradiction. And it will be no leſſe hard to avoyde the ſtroak of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which if he cannot turne aſide; then his propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> now in queſtion, will lie in the duſt, overthrowne (not by anie of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:14068:212"/> our weapons, but) by the turninge of thoſe upon him, which he put into our hands.</p>
                     <p>As for the Arguments which he addeth, to put new life and ſtrength into his propoſition; though juſt exception may be taken, againſt them (for there is oddes betwixt the uſe of government, not inſtituted by the Apoſtles in ſome Churches; and the retey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it in all Churches, or the altering of that government which they had once eſtabliſhed:) yet will I not proſecure ſuch advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, ſeing we are no leſſe perſwaded then he, that there is a manifeſt truth in it.</p>

But if it be vnderſtood of ſuch Biſhops, as the ſcriptures teſtify to have bin in the Apoſtles times; ſeing they were no Lordly governors; but Paſtors or Biſhops in another function; eyther higher as was Iames the Apoſtle, or inferior as Paſtors of one congregation, I demaund againe (as the Refuter did once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) what need there was, that the Doct. ſhould ſpend ſo many words to prove their approbation. For the approbation of ſuch Paſtors can never conclude the approbation of Dioceſan Prelates ſuch as ours. He muſt therefore beare the blame, of equivocating (in the word Biſhop) or of begging the queſtion; vntill he prove <note place="margin">The Doct. equivoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth or beggeth</note> that <hi>Epaphroditus, Iames</hi> the <hi>iust, Archippus &amp; Aniipas,</hi> were Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan Biſhops like to ours.</p>
                     <p>The beſt defence that the Doct. maketh for himſelfe is this. <hi>Til he can diſprove</hi> (ſaith he ſect. 6. pag. 43.) <hi>the former part of my ſermon and of this Treatiſe; he muſt give the Reader leave to think they were ſuch as they have bene manifeſtly proved to be.</hi> If he have manifeſtly proved (in any part of his ſerm: or defenſe before delivered) that the four me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſpeaketh of or any of them, were Dioceſan Biſhops, like unto ours, good reaſon, his reader ſhould have leave to think they were ſuch; but if hitherro he hath not (as it is moſt certaine he hath not) delivered any one word that carrieth the leaſt ſhewe of any ſuch proofe; then the reader I hope (whither he have leave or no) will think that the D. is too forward to ſay he hath proved that, which he never till now propoſed; viz. that theſe foure men were Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan Biſhops. The proofe of this Propoſition both his Refuter and Reader will call for, till they ſee it. And I ſtill ſay, that the proofe of the Aſſumption, (which in a generallity affirmeth, that they were approved of the Apoſtles in reſpect of their function) might well have bene ſpared. And the Doctor aſſuredly doth flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter himſelfe in vaine, while he <hi>conceiveth that there is ſomewhat in this point which his Refuter could wiſh had bene ſpared; or at leaſt whereabout he meaneth to ſpare his anſwer.</hi> For, what ſhould he have anſwered, more then he hath, touching the ſcriptures which the Doctor alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to prove, that the perſons before mentioned were approved of the Apoſtles in reſpect of their function for no man doubteth, but their functions were approved; all the doubt is, whether their functions were ſuch, as our Dioccſans are; and this the D. witting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly overpaſſeth.

                     <p>And 2. ſince the ſimpleſt that hath peruſed the Refuters anſwer (pag. 130.) may eaſily perceive, that (in denying Epaphroditus to be an Apoſtle) he meant, that he had not that function of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtleſhip, which under that name is given to S. Paul; I nothing doubt, but every indifferent reader will judge that he is over mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertly, and very injuriouſly cenſured by the Doctor, when he ſaith, <hi>it was malipertly ſayd by the Refuter that he was not an Apoſtle.</hi> Nay it were a malipert ſpeach, for the Doctor to ſay ſimply and without addition; that he was an Apoſtle ſeing he cannot ſhewe any one text in the newe Teſtament, that giveth that title ſimplie vnto any other, then unto Chriſt and his Apoſtles.</p>
                     <p>3. And wheras he ſaith, that the word Apoſtle which he allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:14068:213"/> doth prove that Epaphroditus was a dioceſan Biſhop; I dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, why he never alledged the word for that purpoſe, and ſhew his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how to diſcerne a dioceſan Prelacie in it? In deed in his next argument, (ſerm. p. 71.) he bendeth his ſpeach that way: &amp; his Refuters readines to apprehend his purpoſe, and to join iſſue with him therein, may and doth (I doubt not) perſwade the indifferent reader, that if the Doctor had as plainely diſcovered any ſuch proof here, he would never have balked it; he plaieth therefore an egregi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <note place="margin">The Doct. calumnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth.</note> calumniators part, in ſaying that the Refuter balked the word (alledged to prove the dioceſan Biſhopprick of Epaphroditus) of purpoſe, to deceive the ſimple.</p>
                     <p>4. But I merveile what giddines hath taken hold on the Doct. that he runneth in and out, this way and that way, at his pleaſure; before we heard touching the word, <hi>ſunergos,</hi> that he placed that copartnerſhip in the function which Epaphroditus had with S. Paul in the Apoſtleſhip, and not in the office of a dioceſan Biſhop; yet now he ſaith, that the name of an Apoſtle given to Epaphro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditus proveth him to be a Dioceſan Prelate. I demaund therefore, if Epaphroditus had none other Apoſtleſhip then a dioceſan By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhopprick how could he be a copartner in function with Paul, by reaſon of his Apoſtleſhip vnleſſe Saint Paul alſo, had bin a Dioceſan Byſhop by his Apoſtleſhip? And againe, yf his Copartnerſhipp in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>function with Paul, proveth him not to be a Dioceſan Biſhop; how ſhould it prove him to be his copartner in the Apoſtleſhip, vnleſſe his Apoſtleſhip were a function diverſe from the calling of a dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan Byſhop? The truth is, as the Apoſtle had no copartnerſhip with Epaphroditus in the function of a dioceſan Biſhop, ſo neither had Epaphroditus any copartnerſhip with the Apoſtle in the Apoſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.

But <hi>more of this</hi> (he ſaith) wee ſhall heare hereafter, and I finde (in the next Chapter, ſect. 12. 13. 14. whereto he ſendeth us) ſome humane teſtimonies to prove that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paphroditus was the Paſtor or Biſhop of the Philippians, &amp; an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the reaſons alleadged by the refuter for the juſtifying of an other interpretation of the word <hi>apoſtolos, viz. that he was their meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger to S.

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:14068:214"/> vpon it: yea (ſect. 15. pag. 71.) he ſaith, that there he is ſo farre from inferring or proving it, that he preſuppoſeth it, as ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved before; and yet in his whole volume, concerning dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſan Churches or Biſhops (Defence lib. 3.) he hath not a worde that particularly toucheth Epaphroditus. Wherefore, it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that the Dioceſan Biſhoprik aſcribed to Epaphroditus is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſed onely but not proved, to be infolded under the word <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle.</hi> And conſequently the commendation which Paul giveth him (Phil. 2. 25.) cannot conclude an approbation of his ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed epiſcopall function.

Forſooth, <hi>Byſhops</hi> are included; and diverſe things ſpoken of Miniſters in generall, doe principally belong to Byſhops. Be it ſo in his vnderſtanding; but can he perſwade himſelf that his bare affirmation will perſwade the conſcience of an indifferent reader to interteine the opinion? no no, we have learned from his owne inditing (lib. 1. p. 200.) how to frame him an anſwer. If dioceſan Byſhops, ſuch as ours, were firſt proved by other arguments to be of divine inſtitution; the beſt argument that could be raiſed out of theſe places, were from the <hi>Genus</hi> to the <hi>species</hi> affirmative; as if he ſhould ſay, The Scriptures ſpeak of Church-Angels, and Rulers which were Miniſters of the word; Ergo of dioceſan ruling Byſhops, But ſeing they never were, nor ever will be proved by other arguments; the reaſon taken from thoſe places, is from the <hi>Genus</hi> to a fancied and platonicall <hi>Idea,</hi>
                        <pb facs="tcp:14068:216"/> or poeticall <hi>species,</hi> and that affirmatively. If we ſhould ſay, it were a bird, therefore a ſwan; it were but a ſimple argument. But if thus, it is a bird, therfore a black ſwan, it were too ridiculous, yet ſuch is the argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of this diſputer. For if he ſhould ſay, The Holy Ghoſt in theſe. 3. ſcriptures, (Apoc. 1. 20. Heb. 13. 17. &amp; Phil. 2. 25.) ſpeaketh of miniſters, which diſpenſed the word and ſacraments; therefore of Biſhops which had prehemine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce over other miniſters; it were a weak argument: but when he inferreth, therefore of dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan Biſhops ſuch as ours, which were more rare then black ſwann; it is very ridiculous.</p>
                     <p>But to diſcend vnto the particulars; it is already ſhewed, how <note place="margin">Sect. 3.</note> much he deceiveth himſelfe &amp; his reader, in fancying the function of Biſhops ſuch as ours, to be deſcribed in his text, under the name of the angels of the 7. Churches. And all may ſee how guilty he is of a plaine contradiction in reſtrayning now unto Biſhops alone, <note place="margin">A plaine contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the Doct.</note> the ſame title which in his other ſermon he extended to all Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, viz. to be called not onely Angels, but alſo angels of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. The ſame contradiction he incurreth, if he will appropriate vnto Biſhops thoſe wordes, Heb. 13. 17. obey your rulers ſeing he applyed them in his former ſermon, unto all Miniſters. To ſay, as now he doth, <hi>(that all Paſtors are Rulers of their ſeverall flocks, but the Biſhops are Rulers both of them and their flocks)</hi> doth rather weaken, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtrengthen his preſent purpoſe. For what one word in all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of that text, can lead any man to think, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle doth there bind the Paſtors of ſeveral flocks to yeeld obedience unto a Dioceſan Biſhop ſet over them? Doth not the contrary ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appeare very clearely? But I will let him ſee his errour, not in my owne words; but in the words of one of our learnedeſt Biſhops, (from whom the Doctor received ſo good ſatisfaction) the Biſhop of Wincheſter (in his confutation of the Seminaries, pa. 164. 165. in quarto, printed at Oxford. Firſt, touching the tranſlation of the word <hi>egoumenois,</hi> he ſayth, <hi>it ſignifieth leaders, as well as rulers,</hi> and in this place ſtandeth rather for Leaders, then Rulers: but S.

The which to conclude from the former inſtance given by him, he muſt thus argue, <hi>Epaphroditus is called the Philippians Apoſtle (Phil. 2. 25.) because be ſucceeded the Apoſtles in the government of that particular Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But Epaphraditus was the Biſhop or Paſtor of Philippi in function like to one of our Biſhops. Ergo, Biſhops, ſuch as ours were called in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles writings, the Apostles of the Churches; becauſe they ſucceeded the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, in the government of the particular Churches.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Both the parts of this argument are contradicted by the Refut: and yet the Doct. harh nothing that can give ſufficient confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the one or other. Some teſtimonies he hath, that may ſerve to uphold (as farr as their ſtrength wil ſtretch) the one half of each propoſition (viz. that Epaphroditus is called the Apoſtle of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians, and that he was their Biſhop or paſtor) but he hath no ſhadowe of any teſtimony or reaſon, to cover the nakednes, eyther of the firſt (which ſaith he was ſo called, becauſe he ſucceeded the
<pb facs="tcp:14068:217"/> Apoſtles in the government of that Church) or of the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d (which affirmeth him to be a Biſhop in function like to one of ours). All his labour te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth to make good againſt his Refut: anſwer an other point, (ſomething differing from the former) viz. that he was ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called the Apoſtle of the Philippians, becauſe he was their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop or Paſtor. Which might be granted, and his purpoſe, there-by at all nothing furthered. For it is a weak conſequence and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phirticall, thus to argue; The office of a Biſhop or Paſtor, is noted in Epaphroditus; when he is called the Philippians Apoſtle: Ergo Dioceſan Biſhops, ſuch as ours, are in the ſcriptures called, the Apoſtles of the Churches. But let us ſee by what authoritie he is ſwayed to imbrace that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which he giveth to the words of the Apoſtle (Phil. 2. 25.) <hi>humoon apostolon</hi> firſt, in tranſlating the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>their Apoſtle;</hi> and then in ſaying, he was therefore called <hi>their Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,</hi> becauſe he was their Biſhop or Paſtor.</p>
                     <p>Firſt touching the tranſlation; however the word <hi>Apostolos,</hi> be <note place="margin">Sect. 5.</note> uſually in the newe teſtament, appropriated unto ſuch as we call Apoſtles (men immediately called of Chriſt, to an univerſall &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limitted Miniſterie;) yet is it well knowne, both that Epaphrodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus was none of them; and that the word (in his moſt naturall ſignification) is of as large uſe, as our English word, <hi>Meſſenger.</hi> And in this large fenſe it is uſed by Chriſt, Iohn 13, 16. <hi>oude Apoſtolos &amp;c.

<pb facs="tcp:14068:218"/> and publiſhed by his Majeſties ſpeciall commaundement. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, whereas he aſſumeth it as a graunted truth, <hi>that Epxphrodstus was called the Apoſtle of the Philippians,</hi> I may ſafely contradict him thus, he <hi>is not called their Apostle but their Meſſenger.</hi> And ſurely had Mr D. ſtudied in this controverſy (wherein the tranſlation al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in our Church is called into queſtion) with the ſame af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and reſolution, with which (if we may beleeve him in his preface to his ſermon pag. 3.) he was carried in ſtudying the whole controverſie of our Church policie. viz. as one that meant to be the reſpondent or defendant, and therefore reſolved not to depart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the received tranſlation; unleſſe with cleare evidence of truth, he might ſee it convicted of errour; doubtleſſe he would herein haue yeelded to his Refuter, and not haue wounded through his ſides, (as he doth) our Church-governours, and thoſe worthy divines, which in their tranſlation doe juſtify his expoſition of this text. Wherefore he deſerveth to have the ſame meaſure which he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to others, to be returned unto him againe, to wit, that being (as it ſeemeth) out of love with our Church-tranſlation; and in affection wholly alienated from our Church-governours, he hath ſtudied this queſtion as an opponent and plaintiffc; there-fore having ſought a knott, as it were, in every bullruſh, &amp; ſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at every gnatt, he hath picked to many quarrells, againſt the Church-tranſlation, and his refuters juſt defence thereof; that by his oppoſition (though the Church be not deprived of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, for he will rather <hi>cry peccavi,</hi> then ſtand to the hazard; yet) he hath opened the mouth of papiſts and atheiſts, to diſgrace our tranſlations; rather then he will without prejudice and parrialitie read, what is truely ſayd in defence therof, for he taxeth deeply the credit of their learning &amp; judgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that have given way vnto it; not onely in the text principally queſtioned, but alſo in two others (2. Cor. 8. 23. &amp; Ioh. 13. 16. where the word <hi>apoſtolos</hi> is tranſlated a Meſſenger, or one that is ſent. For this is his difinitive ſentence (ſect. 14. in fine) that <hi>however the word apoſtolos may ſignify any Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger, with relation to any ſender: yet in the ſcripture it is not uſed to ſignify meſſengers ſent from men; neyther is it to be tranſlated other wiſe then Apoſtle.</hi>

                     <p>But his correcting Magnificat in the tranſlation might be the better born with, yf he altered not the ſence &amp; ſignification of the word, as he doth, in ſaying, that <hi>he is therefore called the Apoſtle of the Philippin<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, becauſe be was their Biſhop or Paſtor.</hi> And even this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction

But what would you have a man to doe theſe helps ſayling? The beſt gloſſe that he can ſet vpon his cauſe, and the faireſt excuſe for himſelf is, that ſome olde and new writers are partly of his minde.

Cor. 12. 28. &amp; Ephe. 4. 11.) were Biſhops, Ergo in ſaying that Epaphroditus was by the Apoſtle, made their Apoſtle, Phil. 2. 25. he meaneth that he was affixed and limited to the Epiſcopall charge of that Church, (in like ſort as the later Biſhops were) and for that cauſe, called their Apoſtle. Nay rather, it followeth from Ambroſe his wordes, that the function of Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phroditus had ſome affinitie with the Apoſtleſhip; I meane in this, that he had onely a temporarie overfight of that Church, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle himſelf had before, during the time of his aboade there. And this hath confirmation from the wordes that follow, which the Doctor was wiſe enough to conceale, his whole ſpeach is this. <hi>Erat enim corum Apoſtolus, ab Apostclo factus, dum illum in exhortationerie eorum mittebat ad eos, &amp; quia vir bonus erat, deſiderabatur a plebe.</hi> Where note, <hi>he was deſyred of the people</hi> (not becauſe he was their Paſtor, but) <hi>becauſe he was a good man;</hi> and was now ſent vnto them by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, (and ſo made their Apoſtle) for their preſent inſtruction or exhortation, &amp; not to take perpetuall charge of them; for as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes he ſaith (in verſ. 27. <hi>neceſsarius erat eccleſiſs)</hi> he was neceſſary for many other Churches, as one that yeilded <hi>(ſolisium er auxilium)</hi>
                        <pb n="25" facs="tcp:14068:219"/> both comfort &amp; help to the Apoſtle. By all which it appeareth, that (in Ambroſe his judgment) Epaphroditus by his miniſteriall function, was an Evangeliſt and not affixed to the Church of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippi as their Biſhop. There remaineth Theodoret, whoſe wordes make the faireſt ſhewe for him; yet are they not ſo full, as he prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth for that which he ſaith (in Phil. 2. 25. he called him an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, becauſe to him the charge of them was committed &amp;c. might very well be affirmed of an Evangeliſt; ſeing they had a temporary charge, of ſome one or moe Churches committed to them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it doth not neceſſarily argue his function to be properlie epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall, and ſuch as now is controverted. Yea the Doctor himſelf, doth ſo vnderſtand Theodoret, when he faith (in 1. Tim. 3.) that thoſe who now are called Biſhops, were at the firſt called Apoſtles, and that thus Epaphroditus was the Apoſtle of the philippians &amp;c. For he gathereth from Theodorets teſtimony, conferred with ſome wordes of Ierom (Def. lib. 4. pag. 72.) that the firſt Biſhops (ſo reputed were Apoſtles, and Apoſtolike men, that is Evangeliſts, and that ſo long as any Evangeliſts or Apoſtolicall men remained, none were choſen our of the Presbyters, to the office of a Biſhop, whence it followeth that Epaphroditus (in Theodorets judgment) is called an Apoſtle, (not becauſe he was a Biſhop, but) for that, he was an Apoſtolicall man, or Evangeliſt. Wherefore it is but a vayn bragge of Mr. D. 1. to conclude, as he doth (pag 67.) that all the Authors which he cited, give teſtimony with his expoſition. And 2. to ask with what face his Refut: could deny it. For although he hath <hi>face</hi> enough to affirme, whatever may ſeem to advantage his cauſe, and to colour the maintenance of what he hath once affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; yet the truth will diſcover it ſelfe to them, that with an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right eye, ſearch after it to their ſhame that ſeek to deface it.</p>
                     <p>Now whereas he addeth that his authors before mencioned, <note place="margin">Sect. 7. ad ſect. 13. p. 68.</note> doe all goe againſt the interpretation of the word <hi>Apoſtolos,</hi> which his Refuter bringeth; he ſaith no more, but what his Refuter had before acknowledged. His Authors were produced, not to confute his Refurer before he ſawe his anſwer, but to juſtify his owne col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the words of the Apoſtle, which ſince he cannot effect, he ſhal doe beſt, not to trouble his reader any further in examining their depoſitions; eſpecially ſeing in ſuch a caſe as this, (when In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters doe varie about the meaning of any word or ſentence in any text of Holy Scripture) the judgment of the indifferent Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:14068:220"/> muſt be ſwayed, (neyther by the number, yeares, or learning of the parties, but) by that weight of reaſon which leadeth them to think as they doe, &amp; beſt accordeth with the circumſtances of the text it ſelfe, and with the uſe of the word or phraſe in other places. Wherefore, the Refuter (though he mencion the names of ſome which imbrace his interpretation, yet) grounded himſelfe rather upon the probability of reaſon; then the creditt of their teſtimony. Notwithſtanding the Doctor much forgetteth himſelfe, to reject ſo lightly as he doth, the judgment of Mr. Beza and <hi>Piſcator;</hi> in ſaying they are aſmuch parties in this cauſe, as the refuter himſelfe. For if it be true, he hath wronged Beza, in affirming, that in the queſtion of Dioceſan Churches and Biſhops, he goeth with him, and againſt his Refuter, (Lib. 1. pag. 48. and Lib. 2. pag. 140. &amp; Lib. 3. pag. 11.) and that he is ſo farr from condemning, the <note place="margin">A contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</note> government of Biſhops reteyned in other reformed Churches, that he wiſhed withall his hart; that with the reformation of religion in the Church of Geneva, the epiſcopall government had bin reteyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; (for ſo he ſayth. Lib: 4. pag. 161. &amp; 166.) but it is no ſtrange thing to the obſervant reader, to find the Doctor very often in this contradicting fault amongſt others.</p>
                     <p>Let us ſee what he anſwereth to the reaſons, that were deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to prove the Refuters conſtruction the more likely. viz. <hi>that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paphroditus is called, their Apoſtle (or rather Meſſenger) becauſe he was ſent by the Philippians,</hi> in their ſtead to miniſter unto the Apoſtle Paul. The firſt reaſon hath two braunches. 1. <hi>That the words following in the ſame verſe and Chap. 4. 18. doe ſhewe how he miniſtred unto him. 2. &amp; the ſame phraſe is vſed to the like purpoſe, 2. Cor. 8. 23. where the breshren ſent with Titus, to receive the Corinthes benevolence, are called Apoſtles, (that is meſſengers) of the Churches.</hi> In his anſwer 1. he acknowledgeth that Epaphroditus brought a gratuitie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Philippia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to Paul, &amp;c. and that the brethren likewiſe which accompanied Titus, were to receive the benevolence of the Corinthians. 2. but he ſaith, it is vnlikely, that eyther he or they, were called the Apoſtles of the Churches, in that regard. And why unlikely? is not that interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation moſtly likely, which beſt agreeth both with the parts of the ſame ſcripture, and with the vſe of the word, or phraſe in other places? And doth not that interpretation much better agree with both them Mr Doct? Let them be compared together, and ſentence given with the truth. Firſt, touching Epaphroditus, that he was
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:14068:220"/> their Imbaſſadour or Meſſenger to the Apoſtle Paul, the evidence alleadged by the Refuter from the ſame verſe, and cap. 1. 18. is ſo pregnant that the Doct. cannot deny it, yea he doth acknowledge it. The word <hi>apostolos</hi> therefore ſignifying properly any Meſſenger (as he muſt alſo confeſſe) it is more then probable (even neceſſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie) to conſtrue thoſe words <hi>humoon apoſtolon, your Meſſenger,</hi> (or at leaſt to take them in this ſenſe, that he is called their Apoſtle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was their Imbaſſadour ſent by them to the Apoſtle, unleſs ſome neceſſarie reaſon can be produced to demonſtrate the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Now what ſaith the Doctor in this caſe? Hath he any ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, or ſyllable from the text it ſelf, or any other ſcripture to juſtify any one of his Aſſertions, viz. that Epaphroditus was their Biſhop, &amp; that he is therefore called their Apoſtle? no ſuch matter. What then? Forſooth, it <hi>appeareth by diverſe of Ignatius his epiſtles, that when the Churches ſent one vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Imbaſsage; the Biſhop was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly intreated to take that Embaſſage upon him. In like manner the Philippi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, being to ſend, as it were upon Embaſſage to Paul, Epaphroditus their Biſhop vndertook that voyage. He being therefore both their Biſhop, and their Imbaſſadour, it is more likely that he was called their Apoſtle, becauſe he was their Biſhop, then for that he was their Imbaſſadour.</hi> I anſwere, 1. may I not ſay that the Churches then ſent forth their Biſhops, as the Apoſtles ſent forth Peter. Act. 8. 14. &amp; the Church, Barnabas, Act. 11. 22? 2. Touching Ignatius Epiſtles; will the D. ſtil preſume upon the credulitie of his reader to take his bare word for proofe, that the Churches in his time, ſent their Biſhops in Embaſſage, only upon intreatie? There is ſmall cauſe he ſhould truſt upon it, when his reader ſhall vnderſtand, that he learned this evaſion of Bella<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min <note place="margin">The Doct. learnetn a ſhift of Bellarmine</note> (de Pont. Rom. lib. 1. cap. 16.) who with this ſhift putteth off that argument which our Divines urge againſt Peters primacie from Act. 8. 14. where he is ſayd to be ſent with Iohn, by the reſt of the Apoſtles unto Samari<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>a. 3. And touching Epaphroditus; ſeing he preſumeth alſo that his word wilbe taken, in ſtead of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter proofe, that he was in like manner intreated to take the jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; he deſerveth to heare from me that which Bellarmin doth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Doct.

Who ſeeth not, that even this Embaſſage argueth, he was not a Biſhop of that degree &amp; dignity that one of our Biſhops bear at this day? Moreover, (to paſs by for the preſent his begging the queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in aſfirming him to be their Bp.) if he were both their <note place="margin">The Doct. beggeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</note> Biſhop and Embaſſadour; is it not more likely, that he was called their Apoſtle, becauſe he was their Imbaſſadour (ſeing the word im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth ſo much) then for that: he was their Bp? but he hath better probabilities in ſtore to prove, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie; let us givehim hearing.</p>

                        <hi>It is unlikely</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that the name of that ſacred function of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles of Chriſt (who alſo himſelf is the Apoſtle of our profeſſion) ſhould be uſed in <note place="margin">Sect. 8. ad pag. 66. &amp; 67.</note> the Scriptures, to ſignify the Meſſengers of men.</hi> Is it vnlikely? why? doth he not knowe, that the offices of paſtors and deacons, are alſo ſacred functions; and that Chriſt himſelf is intitled our Shepheard, and Paſtor of our Soules.

Revel. 10. 1. 5.) yet it is given alſo, in the Holy Scriptures, vnto the meſſengers of men, Iam. 2. 25. where Rahab is ſayd to have received <hi>(tous aggelous)</hi> the meſſengers and ſent them out another way. It is apparant therefore, that neyther the holynes of the Apoſtolike functio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor the worthines of Chriſts perſon or office, can yeild any probable argument, to juſtify the Doctors affirming it to be <hi>unlikely that the word apoſtolos ſhould be uſed in the ſcriptures to ſignify the meſſengers of men.</hi> But heare we him again, he addeth, <hi>that in both places</hi> (Phil. 2. 25. and 2. Cor. 8. 23.) <hi>the Apoſtle intendeth by this title, highly to commend Epaphroditus and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; but this had bene but a ſmall commendation, that they were meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of the Churches.</hi> But a ſmall? How ſmall ſoever the commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſeemeth in the Doct. eyes, who eſteemeth baſely of the church in compariſon of their Biſhop, yet is it otherwiſe in their eyes (ſee
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:14068:221"/> Heming: &amp; Hyper: in 2. Cor. 8.) who concurre with us in the tranſlation of both texts; among whom are many (the tranſlators of our Church-bibles former &amp; later) whom he dareth not accuſe (Iam ſure) to be parties with us in this controverſie. But what ſpeak I of their judgment, ſeing we have the Apoſtles own teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; that having given to one this high co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation, <hi>his praiſe is in the gospel throughout all the Churches,</hi> doth yet enlarge his praiſe in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>&amp; not that onely, but he was alſo choſen of the Churches to traveile with us, with this grace which is adminiſtred by us,</hi> &amp;c. (2. Cor. 8. 18. 19.) and therefore alſo he ſignifieth (1. Cor. 16. 3.) that he would not ſend thoſe that were to carry the benevolence of the Corinths un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Ieruſalem without their letters of commendations. And by theſe teſtimonies of the Apoſtle, we ſee the falſehood of that which he aſſumeth in his laſt reaſon, ſpecially fitted to prove that they (in 2.

He falſly conceiveth, that Paul was as high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded as ſome Biſhops now are; who ſcorn to aſſociate any others with them, in the choiſe of ſuch as they ſend abroad. For we learn from Pauls owne mouth, that he was of an other mind: he ſaith expreſſly that one of thoſe two, whom he ſent, was choſen by the Churches, to be his fellow-traveiler, to convey their benevolence. 2. Cor. 8. 19. and his foredealing with the Corinthes ſheweth (1. Cor. 16. 3.) that he meant not to ſend any other, with theire contribution, then ſuch as they ſhould chooſe and approve by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
                     <p>The Refuters firſt reaſon being thus recovered out of the Doct. handes and mainteyned againſt all his exceptions; his interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">Sect. 9 ad. ſect. 14. pa. 69.</note> will ſtand firme enough (as having both the circumſtances of
<pb facs="tcp:14068:222"/> the text it ſelf, and the uſe of the like phraſe alſo here, to juſtifie it) although his 2. reaſon ſhould be found too weake. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, I doubt not, but to make it good, if the Refuter may have that favour which reaſon alloweth to every one; I meane to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prete his owne meaning, ſo as the wordes may well beare, without wreſting, or contradiction to any parte of his writing. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is this; <hi>Is ſtandeth not ſo well with the propertie of the word apoſtolos, which ſignifieth a Meſſenger, to entitle any man (in regard of his miniſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all function)</hi> their <hi>Apostle</hi> to <hi>Whome, as his</hi> from <hi>whom he is ſent.</hi> Againſt this, the Doctor directly oppoſeth not, for though he ſay, <hi>that in the Scripture the word is uſed with reference, aſwell to the parties to whome; as to the partie from whom the Apostle is ſent:</hi> yet the truth thereof ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth not the Refuters aſſertion to be falſe. For he ſhall bewray his own ignorance, or want of judgment, if he preſſe this for a good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequence. <hi>The word is uſed with reference aſwell to the one as to the other; Therefore both phraſes of speach doe equally and alike agree with the proper ſignification of the word.</hi> For if both phraſes have a like agreme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with the proper ſigniſicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the word; then in both the word may be (with a like fitnes) tranſlated Meſſenger; but that were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd; for though wee may fitly lay of Paul, or any other called the Apoſtle of Chriſt. (1. Cor. 1. 1. 1. Pet. 1. 1. Iude, verſe 17.) that he was the Meſſenger or Embaſſadour of Chriſt: yet were it a very improper and unfitting phraſe of ſpeach, to ſay of Paul, that he vvas the Meſſenger or Embaſſadour of Gentiles, when he intitleth himſelfe <hi>(ethnoon apoſtolos)</hi> the Apoſtle of the Gentiles. Rom. 11. 13. To ſpeak properly, he was not their Apoſtle, but Chriſts; <hi>vocatus a Chriſto principaliter vt eſſet Doctor gentium;</hi> as Piſcator obſerveth (upon thoſe words) and himſelf ſheweth (1. Tim. 2. 2. 7 &amp; 2. Tim. 1. 11. Where it is ſayd, that unto Paul was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted the goſpel of the uncircumciſion. Gal. 2. 7. May we (with as good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the proper ſenſe of the word <hi>evaggelion</hi> goſpell) call his goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell; the uncircumciſed Iewes goſpel; as we may call it, Gods goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, from thoſe words. (Rom. 1. 1.) where he ſaith, he was ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to preach the goſpel of God? It is cleare that in theſe places, Rom. 11. 13. and Gal. 2. 7. as alſo in the verſe following, where Peter is ſayd to have the Apoſtleſhip of the circumciſion) the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive caſe muſt be interpreted, eyther by the dative, as in the firſt, I am the Apoſtle of the Gentiles, that is, to or for the Gentiles, as he ſayth, 1. Cor, 9. 2. if I be not an Apoſtle <hi>(allois)</hi> unto others; yet
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:14068:222"/> doubtleſſe I am <hi>humin</hi> to you) or elſe by an equivalent phraſe as the Apoſtle interpreteth himſelf, Gal. 2, 8. 9. Q. d. to me was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the goſpel of the uncircumciſion; &amp; to Peter the goſpel or Apoſtleſhip of the circumciſion, that is to ſay, to me was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the diſpenſation of the goſpell <hi>(cis ta ethne,</hi> vnto or towards the Gentiles; and to Peter, the like diſpenſation or Apoſtleſhip <hi>(eis ten peritomen)</hi> towards the circumciſion. What cauſe then, hath the Doctor to inſult over the Refuter, ſaying, that whiles he goeth about to diſcover his ignorance (as if he knew not the ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the word <hi>apoſtolos</hi> as well as he) he bewrayeth his owne? For wherein bewrayeth he is own ignorance? Perhaps in ſaying that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the titles that Paul taketh to himſelfe to magnify his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, he never calleth himſelfe their or your <hi>Apoſtle;</hi> but an <hi>Apostle</hi> of Chriſt, or Apoſtle to them? Nothing leſſe; if his meaning be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, as the coherence of his whole ſpeach requireth. viz. that he never called himſelf <hi>their</hi> or <hi>your Apoſtle;</hi> but an <hi>Apostle</hi> of Chriſt, or Apoſtle to them? Nothing leſſe; if his meaning be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, as the coherence of his whole ſpeach requireth. viz. that he never called himſelf <hi>their</hi> or <hi>your</hi> Apoſtle, taking the word in his proper ſignification, of a Meſſenger or Imbaſſadour. For the Doct. himſelf confeſſeth, that when the Apoſtle calleth himſelfe the Apoſtle of the Gentiles, (Rom. 11. 13.) he uſeth the word with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, unto the parties to whom he was ſent; which argueth the Apoſtles meaning to be this, (not that he was their Meſſenger, but) that he was Chriſts Imbaſſadour ſent to them. If he ſhall yet urge that thoſe words may warrant him to ſay, that Paul was their Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle; I graunt it; but withall he muſt knowe, that in ſo ſaying, the word <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> doth not now ſignify a Meſſenger, but a Teacher (or Miniſter of the word) holding that peculiar function, which the 12 Apoſtles enjoyed. If the Doctor know not this, it is groſſe igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in him; if knowing it, he ſhall yet indeavour to juſtify his ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

As for the concluſion which he inferreth, (viz. <hi>that in the Scriptures, the word Apostolos, is not uſed to ſignifie Meſſengers ſent from men, nether is it to be tranſlated otherwyſe then Apostle)</hi> I have already ſhewed (ſect. 5.) how much he wrongeth our owne Church go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours (beſides many other worthy and ſound divines) who have taken the word, for any meſſenger from men, and ſo tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it.

The coherence of the text (both here and elſwhere, where the like ſpeach is uſed as Cap. 15. 20. Math. 10 24.) clearly ſheweth, that Chriſt intendeth to teach his Apoſtles, that they ought to imitate him in ſubjecting themſelves, both to beare the like afflictions (which is the ſcope of the other 2. places) and to performe the like ſervices (which he aymeth at in this place) vnto another. To effect this his purpoſe, he argueth (a genere) in this manner; no ſervant, diſciple, or meſſenger, is greater then his L. and Mr. or him that ſent him. But ye are my ſervantes diſciples &amp; meſſengers; and I am that Lord &amp; Mr. and he that ſendeth you in Embaſſage. Ergo, you are not greater then I; and conſequently, you ought to ſubject your ſelves, both to doe and ſuffer, what ye have ſeene in me. I could alledge Interpreters old and new, that thus underſtand the words of Chriſt, in the generall and largeſt ſense: but it ſhal not be needful to them, that conſider how abſurd it is to reſtreine ſo generall a ſentence, vnto one onely particular. For if I may uſe the Doct. words, Lib. 1. pag. 226. who ſhal dare to doe this without very good warrant? The Doct. concluſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus removed out of the way, I here again inferre (as the Ref. did once before) that he is deceived &amp; ſeeketh to deceive by the equivocation of the word <hi>apoſtolos</hi> which ſometimes in a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon and generall ſenſe, is given to any one, that is ſent as a meſſenger, though uſually aſcribed to thoſe, that were imployed (as were the 12.

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:14068:224"/> then to returne him his own a litle before ſpoken to the Ref. with a litle change. This is written as the moſt of his 4 volumes, to bleare the eies of the ſimple; For I cannot think that the D. which vndertooke this courſe, was ſo void of judgment, as here he would ſhewe himſelf to be, if he wrote ſyncerely. What is the point (I pray you) which here he had in hand? was it not to prove that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles themſelves ordeyned Biſhops? doth not the title upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the head of every page of this chapter ſhew it? &amp; what Biſhops did they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyne in his vnderſtanding? were they pariſh Biſhops, or tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry overſeers as were the Evangeliſts? can he juſtify the caling of our Biſhops to be of divine or Apoſtolicall inſtitution, vnleſſe he prove that the Biſhops or Paſtors, to whom the Apoſtles committed the care of particular Churches were like to ours for the ſubſtance of their office? And, to diſcend more particularly to the queſtion, which himſelfe affirmeth to be debated in all this diſcourſe (pag. 65.) viz. whether Biſhops be mentioned in the ſcriptures vnder this name, <hi>the Apoſtles of the</hi> Churches?) is it not to be vnderſtood of ſuch Biſhops as ours are? If he doe neyther prove this, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it, but preſuppoſe it, (or rather take it for granted, without proofe) and if he prove no more (in this diſcourſe, touching Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phroditus) <note place="margin">The Doct. trifleth, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth &amp; ſhifteth poorely.</note> then that which this objection admitteth (to wit, that he was a Biſhop in the generall conſtruction of the word) doth he not ſhew himſelfe to be a trifling deceiver? and what elſe doth he but bleare the eyes of the ſimple, when he ſaith, it is ſufficiently proved before? But this is the poore ſhift (to pay him once again with his owne pag. 71.) which the Doct. uſually flieth unto. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hath nothing to juſtify his aſſertio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, he perſwadeth himſelf (ſuch is his judgment) that in the queſtion of Dioceſes and dioceſan Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, he hath the upper-hand, (becauſe he hath proved, that there were ſuch Biſhops and Churches in the 2. or 3. age after the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles) and therefore when he is foyled in any of his reaſons, that ſhould prove the calling of ſuch Biſhops, to be of divine inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he flieth to this, as his refuge, I have already proved the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to be Dioceſes and the Biſhops Dioceſan: and therefore if you grant that the function of Biſhops was inſtituted of God, and that Biſhops were ordeyned or approved of the Apoſtles, then you graunt aſmuch as I intend to prove. This then being his beſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, the reader may ſee the Doctors ſinceritie, and that he was not wronged by his Refuter when he told him, that he deceiveth
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:14068:224"/> his reader by an equivocation in the word Biſhop. But in deed, he much wrongeth his refuter, and all them whom he calleth his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorts, when (for a requitall) he ſaith, <hi>that they doe deceive their readers, in that they would perſwade them, that becauſe the name Epiſcopus &amp; Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter were confounded, therefore alſo the offices were confounded.</hi> For where doth the refuter or his conſorts thus argue? The objection which he before took notice of, and pretendeth in all this diſcourſe to remove, is (as himſelf ſetteth it down pag. 65.) that the name <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopus</hi> in the Apoſtolicall writings, is given to Presbyters, and that Biſhops (ſuch as ours) are not mentioned in the ſcriptures. For anſwere whereunto, he ſaid then (and now repeateth it againe) that when Presbyters were called Epiſcopi, thoſe who afterwards (and now) are called Biſhops were then called the Apoſtles of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. This he firſt indeavoured to prove by that inſtance of Epa. phroditus Phil. 2. 25; but his fayling therein, is ſufficiently diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; now, once againe he attempteth it, let us attend whether his ſucceſſe be any better.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>For (ſaith he) as I ſayd in the ſermon; whiles the epiſcopall power was in</hi>

                        <hi>the Apostles, and Apoſtolike men; thoſe who had that power were called the Apoſtles.</hi> And what then? Will he hence conclude, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Biſhops (ſuch as afterwards and now have the name appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to them) were then called Apoſtles; doth it not rather follow (much better) on the contrary, that in the Apoſtles times; the name of Apoſtles, was given to no other, then to the Apoſtles themſelves, or Apoſtolike men, which were (as himſelfe acknowledgeth pag 72) Evangeliſts? hath not the Doct. then ſpun a ſaire threed, to ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle his owne cauſe? But ſince he pretendeth to repeat the words of his ſermon, why doth he curtoll them? there he ſaid (pag 71) <hi>whiles the epiſcopall power was, for the moſt parte, in the Apoſtles &amp; Apoſtolike me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, thoſe who alſo had that power, were called Apoſtles:</hi> now he leaveth out theſe words, <hi>for the most part,</hi> and <hi>alſo.</hi> May I intreat him plainely to informe us, what moved him to make this change? It ſeemeth, he thought theſe words (at the firſt) needfull to be added; (as indeed they were) to conclude his purpoſe; for unleſſe he can make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that the power of ordination and juriſdiction over Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters (which he calleth epiſcopall power) was in ſome other beſides the Apoſtles or Apoſtolike men of Evangeliſts; and that thoſe alſo were called Apoſtles, (or at leaſt the Apoſtles of the Churches) he cannot inferre his former Aſſertion, to wit, that thoſe who are
<pb facs="tcp:14068:225"/> now called Biſhops, were then called the Apoſtles of the Churches. And now (it ſeemeth) he foreſawe, that the teſtimonies (afterwards alleadged) cannot prove, any other then the very Apoſtles or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts (whom he calleth Apoſtolike men) to beare the name of Apoſtles, in the apoſtolicall writings; though his witneſſes ſpeak what they can, &amp; he make his beſt advantage of them. 1. he ſaith, that Ambroſe, by Apoſtles in ſome places of ſcripture (as 1. Cor. 12. 28. Epheſ. 4. 11.) underſtandeth Biſhops: but is the Doctor perſwaded, that the ſpirit of God underſtandeth ſuch Biſhops, as are now queſtioned, by the word <hi>Apostles</hi> in thoſe places? If not, why leadeth he his reader into an errour, and perſwade him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve <note place="margin">The Doct. leadeth his reader into that error which him ſelfe diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</note> that which himſelf diſſalloweth?

If not, howe will Cyprians wordes further his purpoſe, which is to prove, that in the Apoſtolicall writings ſuch Biſhops are called Apoſtles? If he be, why is he aſhamed (eſpecially ſeing he hath Biſhop Bilſon (perpet. govern. pag. 226.) alleadging both Cyprian &amp; Ambroſe &amp; Biſhop Barlow (ſerm. in Act 20. 28. fol. 17) urging Cyprian for that purpoſe to inrowle the 12. Apoſtles, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other Biſhops, which he affirmeth to be ordeyned of God, in his laſt argument, hereafter following Cap. 6? Nay, why affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth he the contrary in this 3. chapt. viz. <hi>that ſome of the Apostles were not properly Biſhops.</hi> Yea he there acknowledgeth, that it is true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirmed of the reſt of the Apoſtles, Iames excepted; <hi>that they had not certeyne Churches aſſigned to them, and therefore were not Biſhops.</hi> To conclude, it is apparant to them that (with underſtanding) read Cyprians whole epiſtle, that to increaſe the power and honour of their function who were Biſhops in his time, he preſſeth the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence, which God gaue to the high-prcifts above the reſte (Deut. 17. and Numb. 16.) much more earneſtly, then he doth the prerogative of Chriſts Apoſtles, above the Deacons. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Doctor too much abridgeth the epiſcopal function of her due antiquitie in deriving the originall thereof (at the higheſt) fro Chriſts election of his Apoſtles. For if this later wil prove the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Biſhops to be mentioned in the new Teſtament, under the name of Apoſtles; then will the former as ſtrongly argue, theire function to be mentioned, in the book of Moſes, under the name of that preiſthood, which was given to Aaron and his ſucceſſors.</p>

                     <p>As for the queſtion of the time, how long the name of Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus and Presbyter were confounded; and when the Dioceſan Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, had the name Epiſcopus appropriated to him; it is ſuch as the D. might well have overpaſſed; ſave that he cannot indure to be contradicted, in any point of the leaſt moment. The proceſſe of time whereof Theodoret ſpeaketh, when the name of Biſhops was appropriated to ſuch, as in his dayes were uſually ſo called, was in the Apoſtles time, as the Doct. gathereth (not from any words of Theodoret, but) by conference of him with Ierome. But Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorets meaning is beſt gathered from his owne words, <hi>In proceſſe of time</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>they left the name Apoſtle to thoſe that are properly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Apoſtles; and the name of Biſhop, they gave to them that had bene cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Apoſtles.</hi> Who ſeeth not, that in his opinion the name of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, was not appropriated to that function, which in his time time en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed it, til the name of Apoſtle was left to thoſe that were proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo called? But the Church-governours were called Apoſtles for many yeares after their time, as the refuter ſhewed out of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piphanius and Iſidore. (Anſw. pag. 153.) And the Doct. himſelfe confeſſeth that the name of Apoſtle continued in vſe; ſo long as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Evangeliſts, or Apoſtolicall men remayned. But under that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour Antonius Pius (who reigned vntil the yeare 152.) many of them remained alive as Nicephorus teſtifieth. lib. 3. cap. 22. And as for thoſe Biſhops which by Ignatius are diſtinguiſhed fro Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, &amp; are ſaid by Ierome to have had their beginning at Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria after S. Mark: the Doctor knoweth well enough, it is eaſier for us to deny; then for him to prove that they were Dioceſan Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops ſuch as ours; neyther is it pertinent to the preſent queſtion, here to debate that matter: ſeing we now waite to heare, what can be alleadged from the ſcriptures to prove, that ſuch Biſhops, had their ordination and originall, in the Apoſtles times, and that with their approbation.</p>
                     <p>And though he hath inſiſted long upon this point, being (as he eſteemeth) of great conſequence: yet his maine aſſertion (that Biſhops ſuch as ours were in the Scriptures, called the Apoſtles of the Churches) and the inſtance produced to prove it (to wir, that Epaphroditus the Philippians Apoſtle, was ſuch a Biſhop) doe lie as naked as at the firſt; having no ſhredd of Holy writt, nor any peece of reaſon to cloath them. Wherefore the concluſions that he inferreth upon theſe premiſſes (viz that Biſhops being then called
<pb facs="tcp:14068:226"/> Apoſtoli were ſuperior to other Miniſters, who were called Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teri &amp; Epiſcopi; that ſuch Biſhops as were ſuperior to other Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, were in the Apoſtles times, and mentioned in their writings; and conſequently that the offices of ſuch Biſhops and of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were diſtinguiſhed, even then when the names were confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Theſe are the concluſions, and what are they, but as walles whoſe foundation is layde in the ſande, and dawbed with intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered morter; and therefore how glorious ſoever in ſhew, yet can they neyther longſtand, nor yeild any firme habitation, for our dioceſan Prelates to lodge in.</p>
                     <p>It hath bin already ſhewed, that (in the judgement of ſome of the Doctors owne witneſſes) Epaphroditus and others called the <note place="margin">Sect. 14.</note> Apoſtles (or Meſſengers) of the Churches, were Evangeliſts rather then properly Biſhops; now to make the probability of this point the more apparant, I here tender to Mr Doctor, and the indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent reader theſe conſiderations. Firſt, touching Epaphroditus; his imployment in traveile to and fro, agreeth better to the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of an Evangeliſt then of a Biſhop. 2. and it ſeemeth he was ſent rather for an <hi>interim,</hi> till Timotheus might be ſpared to come unto them (Phil. 2. 19. 25.) then to make perpetuall reſidence there. 3. Moreover there is ſmall likelihood, the cheefe care and overſight of that Church and their affaires, was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to him by the Apoſtle; ſeing he preferreth Timothy therein before him; for of him he ſaith, verſ. 20. 22. <hi>I have no man like minded that will natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally care for your matters &amp;c. But ye know the proofe of him &amp;c. him ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I hope to ſend &amp;c.</hi> which words doe caſt more diſgrace upon Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phroditus if he were their Biſhop then all the titles of commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion given him (verſe 25.) can wipe away. For what praiſe can it be to a Biſhop, to be laborious in other places, and faithfull in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſervices; when in a naturall care for the affaires of his owne Church, he ſuffreth others to goe before him, and ſtriveth not to excell them? 4. Againe, in this epiſtle ſent (as the Doctor ſaith) by Epaphrodirus, it is plaine, he ſingleth out one, whom (though he name not, yet) he honoureth with the title of a naturall or faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful yoakfellowe, cap. 4. 3. and beſeecheth him to help not onely thoſe weomen, which laboured with the Apoſtle in the goſpel, but Clement alſo, and the reſt of his fellow-labourers. If ſo much had bene ſayd for the ſingular preheminence of Epaphroditus, the D. doubtleſſe would have made his beſt advantage of it: wherfore me
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:14068:227"/> thinkes, it ſhould move him, to make a Quere, why the Apoſtles ſhould thus ſingle out an other, if the cheife care of that whole Church, and the overſight of all Biſhops or Miniſters, that there laboured in the Goſpell, were the ſtanding right and ſingular pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of Epaphroditus. And till the Doctor hath yeilded ſome ſtronger probabilities for his aſſertion, then are yet ſeene; I nothing doubt, but the indifferent reader, will ſee and acknowledge, that from the text it ſelfe, we have more reaſon to denie, then he hath to give to Epaphroditus the ſingular ſuperiority of a dioceſan Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, in the Church of Philippi. Secondly concerning thoſe bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that were ſent with Titus to the Corinthians; ſince the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall ende of their Embaſſage, was to ſtirre up thoſe of Corinthe to make ready their benevolence for the poore Saintes at leruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem (2. Cor. 8. 6. 24. &amp; 9. 3. 5.) it is not likely, that the Apoſtle Paul would be the author, or approver, of applying in this ſervice any, that were affixed as Biſhops, to the ſelted charge of particular Churches; eſpecially ſeing there was at that time, ſtore of others that accompanied the Apoſtle in his traveiles; and might better be ſpared, as having no ſetled imployment in any one place. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, it may be probablie (if not neceſſarily) gathered, from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles deſcription of thoſe men; that they were Evangeliſtes, rather then Biſhops. Of the one he ſaith (2. Cor. 8. 18. 19.) <hi>his praiſe is in the goſpell, throughout all the Churches, and not that onely but he was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen alſo of the Churches to be (ſuntcdemos bemoon) our fellow-traveiler, or companion in our journey &amp;c.</hi> And of the other (verſ. 22.) <hi>We have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes proved him to be diligent (or carefull) in many thinges &amp;c.</hi> But there is not one word, that intimateth any bande, whereby they were tied to the ſelted charge, of any particular Church or Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; much leſs can it be gathered from the Scriptures, that they had the ſingular preheminence of dioceſan Biſhops. Wherefore leaving the Doctor to his meditation upon theſe conſiderations; let us pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to ſome other particulars, urged by him, to juſtifye the title of his 3. chapter, viz. <hi>that the Apostles themſelves ordeyned Biſhops.</hi>

For if they be not one, in the D. apprehenſion; how ſhall the direct proofe of the latter, be a direct proof of the former? But ſince he now teſtifieth that he argueth from the <hi>ordination</hi> to the <hi>inſtitution;</hi> I will ſo vnderſtand him. In that which followeth I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but commend his honeſt and plaine dealing; for beholding an overſight in the Ref; (when in this ſenſe, he acknowledgeth the conſequence to be good) he himſelf vndertaketh to lay open the weaknes of it, and confeſſeth freely that a juſt exception may be taken againſt it, viz. that though the Apoſtles ordeyned the perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, yet Chirſt inſtituted the function; for that is the judgment of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Fathers; and among the reſt of Cyprian, who (Lib. 3. ep. 9.) ſaith, that our L. himſelf ordeyned Apoſtles, that is to ſay, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops. Whereto I ſay, that we are beholding to the Doct. that teacheth us to impugne his owne argument and now, ſince (by his owne confeſsion) the conſequence is not good, he muſt be behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to us if we permit it to paſſe without check; for in deed, it is a cleare caſe, that the ordination of perſons, cannot prove the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction it ſelf to be inſtituted of them, that give the perſons their ordination. And here by the way, the reader may ſee how lightly the D. eſteemeth the judgment of the Fathers in this very queſtion wherin he relieth moſt upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their teſtimonie. For if al thoſe Fathers (which affirm the Bps to be the Apoſtles ſucceſſors; &amp; that the two degrees of Bps or Presbyters, doe anſwer to the degrees of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles &amp; 72 diſciples &amp;c.) doe hold the epiſcopall functio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:14068:228"/> Chriſts owne ordinance; (as here he confeſſeth) and if they that thus teach be ſo many, ſo ancient, vnſuſpected and approved; <hi>that it cannot be denied, but the calling and ſuperiority of Biſhops, togither with the inferiour degree of Preſbyters, is of Christs owne institution</hi> (as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth lib. 3. p. 32.) how co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth it to paſſe, that the Doctor hath the forehead eo deny it, and mainteyne ſo ſtifly as he doth; that <note place="margin">The Doct. contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</note> the epiſcopall function was inſtituted by the Apoſtles? Thinketh he to ſalve this difference by ſaying as he he doth that of this matter he will not contend; when as yet he contendeth very earneſtly to make good his aſſertion? yea he boaſteth (lib. 3. pag. 24.) that he hath with ſuch evidence demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrated the calling of Biſhops de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in his ſermon to be of Apoſtolicall inſtitution; as he is wel aſſured, his Refuter with all his partakers, will never be able ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cially to confute. Perhaps his beſt evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is yet behind; for hitherto we have ſeene nothing that carrieth any ſuch weight with it, that the Refuter ſhould neede to call for any help of his partakers to remove it; let us therefore attend on the proofe of his Antecedent, which he vndertaketh to effect, <hi>by shewing the time when, the places where, and the perſons whome, the Apoſtles ord: yned Biſhops.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Concerning the time, the Doctor putteth a difference, between <note place="margin">Sect. 2. ad ſect. 2. p3. 49. 50.</note> 
                        <hi>the Church at Ieruſalem and the reſt.</hi> For there, becauſe ſhortly after Chriſts paſſion, a great nomber were converted to the faith; and becauſe it was the Mother-Church, vnto which the Chriſtians from all partes, were afterwards to have recourſe: the Apoſtles, before their diſperſion, <hi>(ſtatim poſt paſſionem Domini)</hi> ordeyned Iames the juſt Biſhop of Ieruſalem. From whence the Refuter gathered this argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Iames the juſt was ordeyned Biſhop of Ieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes after Chriſts paſſion. Ergo the Apoſtles ordeyned Biſhops and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted the Churches to them. Hereat the Doctor is diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, becauſe one part of his argumentation is culled out from the reſt; for his argument (as he ſaith) is an induction ſtanding thus. <hi>The Apoſtles ordeyned Biſhops at Ieruſalem and in other Churches</hi> (which afterwards he doth particularly enumerate) <hi>Therefore they ordeyned Biſhops.</hi> He addeth, <hi>that he proveth they ordeyned Biſhops at Ieruſalem, becauſe they ordeyned Iames the iuſt, and Symon the ſonne of Cleophas, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of Ieruſalem;)</hi> the former he proveth here, the other afterwards according to the order of the time.</p>
                     <p>If the D. meaning (when he penned his ſermon) was to argue, as he now ſaith, no merveile, if his Refuter fayled in diſcerning his
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:14068:228"/> Analyſis, his geneſis being ſo diſordered and confuſed. For the explayning and proving the former antecedent, he propoſeth (as appeareth in this ſect. &amp; ſerm. p. 65) theſe three things to be ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, 1. the time when. 2. the places where. 3. the perſons whom the Apoſtles ordeyned Biſhops. He beginneth with the time, when the firſt Biſhop was ordeyned; and withall declareth the place and perſon: Afterwards he ſheweth jointly the places where, and the perſons whom the Apoſtles ordeyned Biſhops. Now he telleth us, his whole reaſoning is one induction, which ſtandeth in an enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration of places or Churches. And the enumeration of the perſons is made a proſyllogiſme, to juſtify that which is affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for the places. As for the diſcourſe of the time, it hath no place at all in his argumentatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; unleſſe it be to give the Biſhops of Ieruſalem their due place. For in order of time Evodias at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch, Linus at Rome, and Mark at Alexandria had poſſeſſion of their Biſhopricks before Timothy was placed at Epheſus; if the D. be not deceived in his computation, that he delivereth. ſerm: pag. 78. Thus we ſee what a Crypticall diſputer Mr D. is; his argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations are as Oracles, or rather riddles. that require an other Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dipus (rather then ſuch an one as his refut: is) to diſcover the right order of diſpoſing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For who (beſides himſelf) would have found out the Medius terminus which he hath aſſigned; &amp; diſtinguiſhed his firſt probatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the enſuing proſyllogiſm, ſo as he hath done.</p>
                     <p>But let us ſee how he juſtifyeth the parts of his later enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherein he coupleth togither, the perſons with the places. <note place="margin">Sect. 3.</note> Firſt touching <hi>Iames</hi> (whom he affirmeth to be the firſt Biſhop of Ieruſalem ordeyned by the Apoſtles, very ſhortly after the Lordes paſſion;) before he prove the truth of his aſſertion, he yeeldeth two reaſons, why that Church had a Biſhop, aſſigned unto it, lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g before any other Church. 1. becauſe a great number, were within a ſhort time converted to the faith. 2. becauſe it was the Mother-Church; unto which the Chriſtians from all partes were afterwards to have recourſe. Touching the former, I grant, the number was greater then can be ſhewed in any other Church, within ſo ſhort a time; but that this was any reaſon to move the Apoſtles, to ordeyne them a Biſhop, the Doctors bare word in affirming it; is too bare a proofe, to perſwade us to enterteyne it; eſpecially, ſeing he will not allowe a Biſhop to ſuch Churches, as in number doe exceed the converts at Ieruſalem, when Iames in his conceit was ordeyned their Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendent.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:14068:229"/> For there are (as he knoweth well enough) in ſome one of our pariſhes at this day above twice yea thrice 5000. Moreover, if this number were any motive to the Apoſtles to give them a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop; then the time of Iames his ordination was after their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and not (as elſwhere he ſaith) i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mediately after Chriſts paſſion. Now touching the later; I confeſſe alſo, that Ieruſalem was the Mother-church, from which (in ſome reſpect) all other Churches ſprung. For the word of the Lord went out fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ieruſalem (Iſa. 2. 3) &amp; that by Chriſts own appointmt, (Luc. 24. 47) and from thence, the light of the goſpell ſpread over all the world by the Miniſtery of the Apoſtles, &amp; others, which before the diſperſion of that Church were members thereof. Act. 8. 1. 4. 5. &amp; 11. 19. 20. &amp; cap. 1. 8. Neyther deny we, but that many Chriſtians, upon ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall occaſions had recourſe thither. (Act. 11. 29. and 15. 2. 15. 25. 27.) but that the Chriſtians of any other Church (as Samaria or Caeſarea &amp;c) were bound to make repaire thither, as unto their Mother-church; to whoſe juriſdiction they were ſubject, as childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to their Mother, there is no ſyllable of ſcripture to perſwade; much leſſe to beleeve, that the Chriſtians of all parts, were afterwards to have recourſe to Ieruſalem as the Mother-church. For this aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, hath no evidence, eyther of Scripture or ancient Father, to countenance it; let them therefore beleeve it that liſt; we owe the Doct. no ſuch obedience. But ſay, there were a truth in this, which he aſſumeth without proofl; how ſhall it ſtand for a reaſon, to move the Apoſtles, to commit the care of this Church, unto a Dioceſan Biſhop? Why ſhould it not rather be a reaſon there to erect the <hi>Sea,</hi> of an Oecumenicall or vniverſall Pope? If by the Chriſtans of all parts, he meane, of all other Churches in the world; as if ſeemeth he doth, ſince afterwardes he calleth that Church, the Mother Church of Chriſtendome, (pag. 60. of this def.) for why ſhould any of the daughter churches, be exempted from the obedience of their Mother, when others (yea the eldeſt, if any at all) remayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned under her government? But if he will limit his ſpeach to the Chriſtians of that one nation (the charge whereof, he ſaith was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to Iames, pag. 52.) it muſt be the Sea (if of a Biſhop then) of a nationall, and not a Dioceſan Prelate. For if the Church of Ieruſalem was never a pariſh, becauſe it was intended, that as the people of the citie and country were all under one high-prieſt, ſo) all the Chriſtians of citie and country, ſhould be under the Biſhop
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:14068:229"/> of Ieruſalem; (as the Doctor argueth lib. 2. pag. 89) then, for the ſame reaſon, neyther was that Church a Dioceſe, or a province; but a nationall Church, as was the church, over which the High-preiſt was ſet, under the law. Laſtly, to grant aſmuch as in any equitie can be dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, viz. that partly in regard of the multitude of new converted Chriſtians; and partly for the great recourſe thither, of unbeleeving Iewes (as well as of beleevers) out of all partes; it was meet that ſome one of the Apoſtles, ſhould there abide to feed the converted flock, and to labour the converſion of others: howe can this argue a neceſſitie, of giving this Apoſtle a new ordination to the office of a Biſhop in that place? but of this more hereafter.</p>
                     <p>His teſtimonies are to be examined, whereby he proveth that <note place="margin">Sect. 4. ad ſect. 4. pa. 52.</note> Iames was ordeyned Biſhop of Ieruſalem by the Apoſtles. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth with Ierome; and to make him the more gracious, with the Diſciplinarians, he ſaith, it is that Ierome, on whoſe onely au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie almoſt they rely in this cauſe; the like words he hath p. 61 following, and lib. 3. pag. 45. and 58; but this is, (I ſay not, <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most</hi> but) altogither a malicious ſlander. For he is not ignorant, that his refuter every where calleth for proofes from the ſcripture, as others have done before him, &amp; that his teſtimonie is then one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly regarded of them, when he hath the ſcripture to juſtify that he affirmeth. But it well appeareth by his citing Ierome ſo oft in his ſermon (40. times at leaſt, well nigh twice as oft as he alleadgeth any other) that he relyeth very much on his authoritie. To him here he addeth Euſebius, Epiphanius, &amp; ſome others; whoſe teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie in his conceit, ſhould ſuffice to perſwade for ſuch a matter, as this now in queſtion. But his Refuters exception is juſt, <hi>ſuch a ioynt act of the Apoſtles in the beginning of the Church (as the ordeyning of Iames to the epiſcopall charge of Ieruſalem) how ſhould it be proved but by the ſcripture? and who could better testify it, then the Evangeliſt Luke, who wrote the hiſtorie of their actes? If then he hath not recorded it, it is a ſtrong preſumption, he was never Biſhop there.</hi> The Doct. replyeth ſaying, as though the Apoſtles did nothing, but what is recorded in the Actes; and <hi>as though we ſhould deny credit, to the ancienteſt writers, &amp; ſuch as he of beſt credit, reporting with one conſent a matter of fact not regiſtred in the actes.</hi> As for the antiquity and credit of his witneſſes, I overpaſs that conſideration to ſect. 15. &amp;c. I am here to advertiſe the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the poverty of the Doctors ſupply here brought, to releeve the weaknes of his argument. For unleſſe he can make ſure and certein
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:14068:230"/> Proof of this (among other partes of his induction) that S. Iames was ordeyned by the Apoſtles Biſhop of Ieruſalem; how ſhall he ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify his concluſion before ſet down, to wit, that the epiſcopal fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is without quaeſtion of apoſtolicall inſtitution? And howe ſhall certeine and ſure proofe of Iames his ordination to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick of Ieruſalem be made from ſuch witneſſes, as the Doctor hath produced? Are not the canonicall writings of the newe teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (penned partly by the Apoſtles, and partly by Evangeliſts, which were their companions) beſt able to teſtify, what function Iames and other faithfull ſervants of Chriſt did beare and exerciſe, in the Churches, that injoyed their preſence? We find many things recorded by Luke, concerning the Miniſterie of Paul and Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas, Philip and others, by whoſe labours the kingdome of Chriſt was inlarged. Acts 9. 15. 27. &amp; 13. 2. 3. &amp; 14. 14. &amp; 15. 22. 31. &amp; 8. 5. 40. &amp;. 21. 8.) Neyther are the ſcriptures ſilent touching Iames and his imployment at Ieruſalem, (Act. 1. 13. &amp; 15. 13. &amp; 21. 18. Gal. 1. 9. &amp; 2. 9) why then ſhould this ordinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Iames to the function and charge of a Biſhop in that Church, be wholly bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in ſilence, if it had bene the joynt-act of the Apoſtles, before their diſperſion, and an act of that moment, wherein they gave the firſt preſident of a new function of greateſt uſe &amp; higheſt place, for all churches in ſucceeding ages? Was it not as worthy &amp; more neceſſarie to be recorded, then the firſt inſtitution of the Deacons office. Act. 6. 2. 6? Have we not cauſe then to hold it for a ſtrong preſumption, that Iames never had any ſuch ordination; ſeing there are no footſteps of it, in the Apoſtolical writings? and ſeing the Doctors defenſe is ſo ſlight, as it is; mark it I pray; firſt, he asketh whether the Apoſtles did nothing but what is recorded in the Acts; a frivolous queſtion. No man denyeth, that as Chriſt did many things which are not written, (Ioh. 20. 30. &amp; 21. 25) ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo did his Apoſtles, but will he argue thus, They did ſomething not recorded in the ſcriptures, Ergo, they did this, now in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? How doth the Doct. forget himſelfe, thus to open ſo wide a dore unto the Papiſts, to bring in all their ſuperſtitions under the name of vnwritten traditions? Can he give us any one inſtance, of an Apoſtolicall ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce (or of any Apoſtolike actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of like mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and neceſſarie uſe for all Churches) that is not mentioned in their writings; neyther can be proved otherwiſe, then by the ſtories &amp; and writings of the Fathers?</p>
                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:14068:230"/>
                     <p>And this may ſerve for anſwere alſo unto his ſecond queſtion, whether we ſhould deny credit to the ancienteſt Fathers &amp;c. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting with one conſent a matter of fact, not regiſtred in the acts? In ſome matters of fact, credit is not to be denied to their report (as that Iames the Iuſt was martyred at Ieruſalem; and that Mark the Evangeliſt preached the goſpel at Aleandria) but there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny matters of fact, teſtified by many ancients (and thoſe of the beſt credit as the D. ſpeaketh) which notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, many worthy me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (nothing inferior to the Doctor) eſteem worthy of no credit. I wil inſtance only in Peters Biſhoprick firſt at Antioch &amp; then at Rome, which is contended for, not onely by Papiſts, but alſo by ſome zealous defenders of our Prelacie; let the teſtimonies be wel weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which are brought for the maintenance of Peters epiſcopall chaire in both Churches (Rome eſpecially) even by Biſhop Bilſon (perpet. govern. pag. 227. 262. and 264) and they wilbe found to be neyther in number nor in credit, inferiour to thoſe that the D. alleadgeth for Iames his Biſhoprick at Ieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: yet as many other men of ſingular learning &amp; pietie doe deny credit to their report: ſo the Doctor alſo, (as one nothing moved, eyther with the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of thoſe fathers, or with the judgement of his great Mr that gave him ſo good ſatiſfaction in the ſtudying of this contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy) utterly ſecludeth the Apoſtle Peter, from the office of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, in any of thoſe Churches, as we may ſee, ſerm. pag. 81. 82. and in the 7. ſection of cap. 3. def.</p>

                     <p>A Superintendent and a Biſhop (according to the naturall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the words in their originall) is all one; &amp; both of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in a generall ſignification, may very well be applied to that preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie &amp; overſight, which every Apoſtle, or Evangeliſt, had in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Church for the time of their aboad there. For, who had the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendency or governme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t (or, if you will, the epiſcopall charge) of the Church at Corinthe, for that ſpace of a yeare &amp; ſix monthes, which Paul ſpent there in preaching of the word among them; or of the Church at Epheſus, during the ſpace of. 3. yeares, wherein he ceaſed not to warne every one night and day, and to teach them both publikely and from houſe to houſe. Acts. 18. 8. 11. and 20. 17. 20. 31. But as this ſuperintendencie, proveth not S. Paul to have been the Biſhop, eyther of Corinthe, or Epheſus (in the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a dioceſan or provinciall Biſhop) ſo neyther doth the like ſuperintendencie in Iames at Ieruſalem, argue him, to have the function of a dioceſan Biſhop, or Archbiſhop although it could be proved, that he continued in ſuch a Superintende<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie there, for that whoſe ſpace of yeares before mencioned. For it is not the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of 3. or 30. yeares, that diſtinguiſheth the function of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop from an Apoſtle: but an ordination and aſſignement, to the perpetuall charge of one particular Church. The propoſition ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the Doctors argument is not true; vnleſſe, he limiteth the ſuperintendencie, whereof he ſpeaketh vnto this ſenſe; to wit, that Iames was the Superintendent of that Church of Ieruſalem, in the ſpeciall function of a dioceſan Biſhop. But then his aſſumption is falſe; not onely in regard of ſuch an epiſcopall ſuperintendencie; but alſo in reſpect of that length of time, which he aſcribeth to him therein: for the ſcriptures alleadged by him doe not prove, either the one or the other. <note place="margin">Sect. 6. ad ſect. 6. p. 56 &amp; ſect. 8. pag. 60.</note>

As for Gal. 2. he that peruſeth the text may verie well think, the Doct. had neede to have ſkill in Alchymiſtrie, as well as in Divinitie, if he vndertake from thence to extract for S. Iames an epiſcopall ſuperintendencie, at Ieruſalem, yet beholde how he (pag. 56.) attempteth it in this manner; <hi>Iames, Peter, and Iohn gave the right hand of fellowſhip to Paul and Barnabas, that themſelves would be for the circumciſion.</hi> Gal. 2. 9. <hi>And for aſmuch as Peter &amp; Iohn traveiled to other partes, Iames alwaiſe abiding at Ieruſalem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>? doth it appeare in Gal. 2. that any ſuch agreement, was made betwene him and them? no, (he ſaith) <hi>it is very probable that ſo it was;</hi> but there is no likelihood, that Iames was forbidden to goe out of Ieruſalem; ſeing the reſt were not debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from returning thither. I but it is <hi>more then probable that the Church of Iurie was peculiarly aſſigned to him; ſeing Peter &amp; Iohn traveiled into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther partes.</hi> By the Church of Iurie he meaneth (as I ſuppoſe) all the Churches in Iudea, (mencioned Gal. 1. 22. &amp; 1. Theſſ. 2. 14.) and perhaps the reſt that were in Galile &amp; Samaria (Acts. 9. 31.) for who fitter then he to have the overſight of theſe Churches alſo. Now I grant that in their abſence and during his aboade in thoſe coaſts; it is probable, he vndertook the care of thoſe Churches; like as Peter had the cheife overſight of the Iewes, that were ſcattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia &amp;c. (1. Pet. 1. 1.) during the time of his ſtay in thoſe parties. But as Peter remeined ſtill the Apoſtle of the Circumciſion, &amp; became not properly their Biſhop. (which the Doctor acknowledgeth pag. 57. &amp; 97.) ſo neither doth it followe that Iames, had any epiſcopall (but rather onely an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolicall) Superintendencie over the Churches of Iurie. But
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:14068:232"/> paſſe we forwardes, the Doctor addeth, <hi>it is not for nothing that both in Acts. 15. he is noted as preſident, or cheife in that Councel, and in Gal. 2. 9. Paul speaking of ſuch Apoſtles, as were at Ieruſalem, he giveth the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to Iames before Peter and Iohn.</hi> I graunt that Iames was Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in that Councell held at Ieruſalem, Acts 15. and that he hath a prioritie in nomination before Peter and Iohn. Gal. 2. 9. ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are theſe things recorded for nothing, but for our learning aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well as all other parts of holy writ. Rom. 15. 4. But will the Doct. be pleaſed to diſcover vnto us the depth of that learning, which he findeth to lie hid in theſe places? yea he hath done it. ſerm. pag. 68. and Def. pag. 60. next following; In the former he ſaith, It appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth Acts. 15. that Iames after his election to the Biſhoprick, was ſuperior (though not in degree yet) in order, vnto the reſt of the Apoſtles, when &amp; whiles they were at Ieruſalem. And in the later, he quoteth. Acts. 15. &amp; Gal. 2. to ſhew, that becauſe he was ſet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Mother-church of Chriſtendome, to be the Apoſtle or Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of that people, which had ſundry prerogatives above al other natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s) in reſpect of that place, he had precedence before the other Apoſtles. In which words there are ſome cleare truthes which muſt be divided from other more doubtfull pointes. Of the former ſort (not to mention againe, the preſidence &amp; priority before acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in S. Iames) we account theſe particulars. 1. that the Iewes had in former ages many prerogatives above all other nations; 2. that the church of Ieruſalem was in ſome reſpect (as is before ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſect. 3.) the Mother-church of Chriſtendome. 3. that Iames was an Apoſtle principally to the Iewes. 4. and that among the Iewes, thoſe of Ieruſalem, and the country round about, did more ſpecially belong vnto his overſight, whiles Peter and Iohn (who were alſo Apoſtles, for the Circumciſion Gal. 2. 9.) were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in other places. 5. laſtly, that during his preſidency (in the Councell Acts 15.) he was ſuperiour in order, but not in degree, vnto the reſt of the Apoſtles. But among things more doubtfull, beſides the queſtion it ſelfe of Iames his election or aſſignement to the function of a Biſhop at Ieruſalem) I reckon theſe poſitions. 1. that a preſidencie in honour, or preheminence in order (ſuch as he ſpeaketh of) is intimated by S. Paul, in ſetting Iames before Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Iohn. Gal. 2. 2. that this precedence is there given him, in reſpect of his epiſcopall charge at Ieruſalem. 3. and that in the ſame reſpect, he had the preſidencie in the councell Act. 15. 4. that
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:14068:232"/> he was alwayes (after the time of his ſuppoſed election to his Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick) ſuperiour in order to the reſt of the Apoſtles, when and whiles they remayned at Ieruſalem. 5. that this continuance of that ſuperioritie in him, appeareth Act. 15. 6. And that this ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority or precedence, did growe from the prerogatives, which that Church and people had above others. To theſe particulars, if the Doctor will have us to give our free aſſent; he muſt firſt inform us, by what authoritie (or conſequence of reaſon) he is ledd to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend a truth in every of them; and remove the probabilities, which doe incline our judgments to the contrary.</p>
                     <p>For touching Gal. 2. are not the wordes of the Apoſtle (ver. 7. <note place="margin">Sect. 7.</note> 8.) affirming, that the goſpel of the uncircumciſion was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto Peter) much more plaine for his preheminence above Iames and Iohn in the Apoſtleſhip of the Iewes, then the naming of Iames before them (verſ. 9. can be) for his primacie above all his fellowe-Apoſtles. Is it not then, much more frivolous and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous in the Doctor to extract for Iames a preheminence in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour above Peter, and the reſt of the Apoſtles, from that ſlender prioritie which Paul giveth him in naming him firſt; then it is in Bellarmine to aſcribe vnto Peter a preheminent dignitie above the reſt, becauſe he is uſually named in the firſt place? Why therfore ſhould not that did up the Doctors mouth, that hath dammed up Bellarmines?) <hi>Sidrac inter adoleſcentes qui in ignem coniecti ſunt, primus numeratur; neque tamen Sidrac ſocijs ſuis prefuit.

                     <p>2. And if no preheminence can ſoundly be conveyed to Iames from this precedence in nomination; is not the D. ſtrangely delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded when he taketh it for a ſure truth, that the Apoſtle intended, (by naming him in the firſt place) to teach us, not onely that he
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:14068:233"/> had a prerogative of honor above the reſt of the Apoſtles; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that the ſame did ariſe from his epiſcopall charge at Ieruſalem? for is there any one word in the whole epiſtle, that giveth the leaſt intimation, of any ſuch difference betweene him &amp; Peter &amp; Iohn, as the Doctor fancieth, when he maketh him properly a Biſhop for ſome; and them Apoſtles for others of the circumciſion? Doth it not rather appeare (by the right hands of fellowſhip &amp;c. mencio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned verſe 9.) that Imaes exerciſed among the Iewes the ſame (and no other) Miniſtery, that Peter and Iohn did; and that they joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were Apoſtles for the Iewes; like as Paul and Barnabas were for the Gentiles?</p>
                     <p>3. And here by the way obſerve, that this diſtribution of perſons or places where theſe were, (after this agreement) to exerciſe their Apoſtolicall function, bred no inequalitie, or diſparitie betwixt them, in precedence or honour. For if the ancient prerogatives of the Iewes, gave any preferment to their Apoſtles above thoſe, by whom God wrought among the Gentiles (as the Do. ſuppoſeth) then Paul was in this reſpect inferiour to the other; but the whole ſcope of his reaſoning, tendeth to mainteyne the contrarie; viz. that as elſwhere he faith, he was <hi>meden busterekenai)</hi> in nothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to the very cheife Apoſtles. 2. Cor. 11. 5. &amp; 12. 11. Now if the prerogatives of the Iewes in generall, gave not to Peter (who had the Apoſtleſhip of the circumciſion) any preheminence above Paul, the Apoſtle &amp; Teacher of the Gentiles: how ſhould Peter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come inferior unto Iames, by reaſon of any preheminence, which the Church at Ieruſalem, might challenge above other Chriſtian Churches?</p>
                     <p>Now concerning Act. 15. as I freely acknowledge, Iames his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidencie <note place="margin">Sect. 8.</note> to be probably gathered from the text, becauſe he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth the diſputation, adn the definitive ſentence of the whole Aſſemblie. verſ. 19. 20. &amp; 28. 29.) ſo I can by no meanes allowe this preſidencie to growe unto him, as his right in regard of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopall charge in that Church, much leſſe can we take the preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie for a ſufficient proofe of his Biſhoprick there; although the Doctor ſhould tell us tentimes, that it proveth it. For what ſtrings can knit the joyntes of this argument togither? Iames was preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent or Moderator in the Synode at Ieruſalem. Act. 15. Therfore he was the Biſhop of that Church. Was S. Paul the Biſhop of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus, becauſe as Biſhop Barlow ſaith in his ſermon on Actes 20.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:14068:233"/> 28. pag. 2. he fate as preſident in the Convocation, when the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie of Epheſus, were by his call, come togither? Or was Peter Iames his predeceſſor in the Biſhoprick of Ieruſalem, becauſe he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident in the choiſe of Matthias, to ſucceed in the roome of Iudas Act. 1. 15? <hi>Surgit Petrus non Iacobus, vt is cui preſidentia diſcipulorum co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſa erat.

                     </p>
                     <p>2. But to come to that which he ſaith doth appeare Act. 15. viz. <hi>that Iames after his election to the Biſhoprick, was ſuperior in order to the reſt of the Apoſtles, when and whiles they were at Ieruſalem.)</hi> May I aske, with what eyes he diſcerned in that text, the appearance of this which he affirmeth? In the Embaſſage which was ſent from Antioch to Ieruſalem, was there any ſpecial reſpect had vnto Iames above the reſt of the Apoſtles? Or in their interteynment, is there any intimation, of any ſingular act performed by him, that might any way argue any ſuch preheminence in him? Doth not the text rather, (in the whole tenour thereof) import the contrary? For, to whom were Paul and Barnabas ſent? to the Apoſtles and Elders ſaith the text, Act. 15. 2. to whom did they deliver their Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage? to the Apoſtles and Elders and whole Church, which recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them, ſaith the text. verſe 4. who ſummoned the Aſſembly, or appointed the time, or place of their meeting? did Iames? the text ſaith not ſo; all the record is, that the Apoſtles and Elders came togither, to conſider of the matter. verſ. 6. There is no likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood therfore, that Iames had any ſtanding preheminence among the Apoſtles, before his preſidencie in this Synode. And what preſumption can he produce fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this text, or any part of the whole ſtorie to ſhewe that he remayned ſuperiour unto his fellowe Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, after that meeting was ended? not a ſyllable out of any text. Wherefore in urging this place to prove, a continued ſuperioritie in order over the reſt of the Apoſtles; ſeing he is as one, who ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to fetch water not fyer, out of a puniſh ſtone, he diſcovereth <note place="margin">The Doct. expumice aquam po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulat.</note> his extreame povertie in this caſe: And (which is worſe) injuriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maketh the Holy Ghoſt the authour of his owne fond conceits. 3. For is it not a fooliſh conceit (to ſpeak no worſe of it) to i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>magin that the function or charge of a Biſhop, caſt upon Iames, being an Apoſtle could give him more honour, then he received of Chriſt by his Apoſtolicall office? Doth not this overturne that difference of dignitie and degree, which God hath ſet in his Church, among
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:14068:234"/> the Miniſters of his word and ſacraments, giving the firſt and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt place (1. Cor. 12. 28. Epheſ. 4. 11.) unto his Apoſtles; and ſubjecting unto them all other functions, aſwell of Biſhops and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors of Teachers, as Prophets and Evangeliſts? And doth it not ſtrongly favour of their madnes, (ſee Doct. Reynolds conference with Hart, cap. 2. diviſ. 3. pag. 119. &amp; cap. 3. diviſ. 1. pag. 126) who acknowledging the Apoſtles to be all equall in the power &amp; honour of the Apoſtleſhip; doe yet aſcribe unto Peter a prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence above the reſt, in regard of paſtorall or epiſcopall juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</p>
                     <p>But to proceed on to the laſt place; Act. 21. 18. &amp;c. what is there <note place="margin">Sect. 9.</note> in it to be found, that can give the Doctor any releife? when Paul came Ieruſalem and went in unto Iames, he found the Elders preſent with him, verſe 18. he ſaluted, (not Iames alone, but) all that were preſent; and declared what things God had wrought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Gentiles by his Miniſterie, verſ. 19. &amp; upon the hearing thereof, they all glorified God, and ſayd, Thou ſeeſt brother, how many thowſands of Iewes there are which beleeve &amp;c. ver. 20-25. From hence the Doct. rightly collecteth (I grant) that Iames had the aſſiſtance of the presbyters (as he ſaith pag. 52.) in that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell and advice, which was given to Paul for the purifying of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and ſhaving of his head &amp;c. verſ. 23. 24. But if he ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from this aſſiſtance of Presbyters, to inferre that therefore Iames was their Dioceſan Biſhop: Firſt I wil make ſo bold as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the conſequence; for why ſhould not Iames his Apoſtolicall fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction inable him, to hold a preſidencie, or cheife place amongſt the Presbyters of Ieruſalem, during the time of his aboad there? we heard before, that Pauls preſidencie, in the aſſembly of the Elders of Epheſus, Act. 20. 17. &amp;c, did not make him their Dioceſan Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop. Who doubteth (ſee Iunius his Animadverſ. in Bellarm. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. 3. lib. 1. cap. 8. not. 25.) but that whereſoever any Apoſtle or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſt made ſtay for a time; there he was acknowledged, (in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his ſingular gifts, and for the prerogative of his calling &amp; authoritie) worthy to haue the overſight or preſidencie, before the reſt of his fellow labourers? The preſidencie therfore which Iames had in the aſſembly of Elders at Ieruſalem, proveth not, that he was their dioceſan Biſhop, in office or preheminence like to one of ours. 2. Nay rather, we may (upon better grounds) conclude the contrary; for it is cleare, by the words of the text aforeſayd, that
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:14068:234"/> Iames neither ſpake nor did any thing in that aſſembly, of his own head, or by his ſole authoritie. The Elders were joyntly intereſſed with him, both in receiving fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Paul, the report of things wrought by his Miniſtrie; and in giving him advice, howe to remove the offence, which the beleeving lewes had conceived againſt him. But it is otherwiſe with our Biſhops; in their Dioceſan government. They have no ſuch aſſiſtance of Elders, by whoſe advice and aſſent their ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces are ratified: neitther doe they conſult with the rectors of their pariſhes, for the ordering of any eccleſiaſticall cauſes; but impoſe their command on them to execute their decrees. S. Iames therfore, (though he were an Apoſtle yet) exerciſed not that preemi ne<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t authoritie over the presbyters at Ieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which our dioceſ. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates doe over their presbyters; and conſequently, he was not a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oceſan Biſhop, in function &amp; preheminent ſuperioritie like to one of ours.</p>
                     <p>Thus the Reader may ſee by ſpeciall viewe taken of the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <note place="margin">Sect. 10. ad ſect. 4. pa. 51. 52. alſo.</note> which the Doctor alleadgeth for the epiſcopall ſuperintenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of Iames, over the presbyters and Church at Ieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; that there is no warrant from the ſcripture, to convey to him any ſuch functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now to lay them togither, let us try if they will affoard him any better proofe, for that 30. yeares continuance, which he giveth unto Iames, in his Superintendencie of that Church. When Paul went to Ieruſalem 3. yeares after his converſion, to viſite Peter, there he found Iames the Lords brother, Gal. 1. 18. 19. he was preſent alſo and Preſident in the Councell held at Ieruſalem. Act. 15. (which was the very time that he mencioneth Gal. 2. 1. as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny divines of beſt note doe judge.) Againe at Pauls laſt comming to Ieruſalem, Act. 21. (about the yeare of Chriſt 56. and 7. yeares before Iames his death) he was there found among the Elders of that Church. In a word therefore, this is all that thoſe ſcriptures doe teſtify for the Doctor; viz. that in 30. yeares ſpace Paul com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming 3. or 4. times to Ieruſalem, found Iames the L. brother there. Is he not then ſtrangely beſotted with prejudice, that can perſwade himſelfe, that theſe ſcriptures doe ſhewe his continuall reſidence at Ieruſalem, as the ſuperintendent of that Church for the ſpace of 30. yeares, that is, from Chriſts paſſion till his owne dying day? What hindreth, (ſave onely a prejudiciall conceit, of his ſuppoſed Biſhoprick there) but he might think; that (like as Paul and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter did, ſo alſo) Iames might ſpend many yeares in other places;
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:14068:235"/> and yet have recourſe thither, (as they alſo had) ſo long as the Iewiſh policie remayned in force? Was he not ordeyned of Chriſt to the office of an Apoſtle, aſwell as the reſt, with an ample commiſſion and charge, <hi>to goe forth into all the worlde, beginning at Ieruſalem &amp; ſo proceeding throughout all Iudea and Samaria, and vnto the vtmoſt partes of the earth &amp;c?</hi> Mark. 16. 15. Math. 28. 19. Luke 24. 47. &amp; Acts. 1. 8. and doth not Mark teſtify of all without exception (verſ. 20.) that (as Chriſt had commaunded them, ſo) they went forth and preached every where? I, but the Doctor will here perhaps, urge that (which he hath alleadged ſect. 4. p. 51. 52.) <hi>though our Saviour bad his Apostles</hi> to goe <hi>into all the World, yet his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was not that every one ſhould traverſe the whole world, for great incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience diſorder and confuſion would have ſollowed thereof. Therefore the Apostles by the direction of the Holy Ghost, before their diſperſion from Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, divided the worlde among themſelves in ſuch ſort, that one beinge aſſigned to one part and another to an other, every man walked within his owne compaſſe, and did not uſually build vpon the foundation of an other &amp;c. 2. Cor. 10. 13.-16. Now as they were carefull to provide for other partes of the world; ſo would they not all forſake Iewrie and Ieruſalem, but aſſigne one of their company to take charge thereof, who though he were an Apoſtle yet being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to the peculiar church of one nation, might not vnfitly be called (as he was in deed) the Biſhop therof. And hence is it, that although the Apoſtles were commaunded to goe into all the worlde, yet Iames stayed at Ieruſalem vntill his death.</hi> Loe here the Doctors wordes, but doe ye not ſee, that his concluſion weakneth the credit of S. Markes teſtimony, in like ſort, as he doth elſwhere (pag. 116.) one ſpeach of Ieromes. viz. <hi>that vntill factions aroſe in the Church</hi> (which occaſioned the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of Biſhops) <hi>the Churches were governed by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon councell of preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters. This,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is vnture, in reſpect of the Church of Ieruſalem; which had Iames for her Biſhop, before any Preſbyters were there ordeyned.</hi> So albeit S. Mark ſaith, that the Apoſtles went forth (as Chriſt commaunded them) and preached every where: yet the Doctor ſaith in effecte, It is vntrue, in reſpect of Iames, for though he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. 30. yeares after Chriſt, yet he went not forth to preach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade, but ſtayed at Ieruſalem vntill his death. But whether Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome doe contradict himſelfe or not, (for how trulie the Doctor ſo ſuppoſeth, we are not now to examine:) his teſtimony is too weak to exempt Iames from partaking with the reſt, in that which Mark affirmeth of all without exception. And it is no ſmall wrong
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:14068:235"/> both to Iames &amp; to his fellow-Apoſtles; to make them all guilty of tranſgreſſing Chriſts command, the one in neglecting, &amp; the other in procuring the neglect of the Apoſtolike functio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. in the principall work thereof: to wit, in traveyling to make diſciples, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute Churches among ſuch as had not yet received the faith. <note place="margin">Sect. 11.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>True it is, that every one was not to traverſe the whole world; this was not impoſed on every one of the Apoſtles ſeverally but on all joyntly: and they were by the ſpirit of God directed where to imploy their labours, Notwithſtanding, it is no true viſion but a deceiptful dreame of the Doctors owne hart, to i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>magin, that the Apoſtles before their diſperſion fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ieruſalem, by the holy Ghoſts direction, divided the world among themſelves, as it were into. 12. provinces, or rather Patriarch-ſhipps in ſuch ſort that none entred into the line or circuit of an other. For had this been ſo, then Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was too blame, to ſtay at Ieruſalem with Iames, when the reſt were gone into other parts, Gal. 1. 18. 19. and to make ſo many yeares reſidence as he did in Iudea, Acts. 19. 32-43. &amp; 10. 23-48. and 11. 2. and 12. 3. 2. And by what right could Paul attempt the planting of the Goſpel in ſo many countries, &amp; ſo far diſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an other, as he did; (Act. 26. 18. &amp; 11. 25. 26. &amp; 13. 2. with 14. 26. &amp; chapters following) if all the world had ben divided vnto the 12. before their departure from Ieruſalem? 3. Or why ſhould Paul &amp; Barnabas be joyned in one co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion, as joynt traveilers in the ſame line, (Act. 13. 2.) if all the reſt had a ſeverall circuit, allotted to each a part? 4. Againe, doth not that agreement, Gal. 2. 9. (when a diſtribution, not of Countries, but of people (Iewes and Gentiles) was made betwene Paul and Barnabas; and thoſe 3. pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars Iames, Peter, and Iohn) argue very probablie, that there was no ſuch diſtribution of the vniverſall world into ſeverall partes (as the Doctor imagineth) formerly ratified by the holy Ghoſt? 5. Laſtly it is apparant, that Paul, (for the coaſt into which he tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veiled) had not his whole compaſſe allotted him at once, but was guided by ſpeciall direction from one place to an other. Act. 13. 2. 4. &amp; 16. 6.-10. &amp; 18. 9. 11. &amp; 19. 21. And as in his own af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, he alwayes ſtrived to preach the goſpell, where Chriſt was not named, leaſt he ſhould build upon an other mans foundation (Rom. 15. 19, 20.) ſo he had from time, to time, the meaſure of his line, diſtributed unto him of God. 2. Corinth. 10. 13. Wherefore as I freely acknowledge, that every one walked within
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:14068:236"/> the compaſſe of his owne meaſure allotted to him by God: ſo I flatly deny, that there was any ſuch generall diviſion of the world, made at once. And concerning Iames, though (for the reaſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore named) I perſwade my ſelfe, he ſpent not all his dayes in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem; yet I graunt he had as good warrant, for the ſtay, which he made there, and the recourſe he had thither, as any the reſt of the Apoſtles had, for their traveile into more remote parts of the world: to wit, the direction of the holy Ghoſt, and not an aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from his fellow-Apoſtles onely. But as the direction or aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignement which Paul had, to publiſh the goſpell in Macedonia, or at Corinthe (Act. 16. 10. &amp; 18, 9.) made him not the Biſhop of thoſe people, or countries; neyther did Peters portion of the Iewes diſperſed throughout Pontus, Galatia, Capadocia &amp;c. 1. Pet. 1. 1.) argue him to be their Biſhop: ſo in like manner, though I ſhould graunt, that Iames his circuite was for the moſt part (or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togither if the D. will) incloſed within the countries of Iudea, Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee and Samaria: yet this limitation doth not prove him to be, the provinciall or natonall Biſhop of thoſe Churches. The D. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore buildeth upon that weak and ſandy foundation of his own (or other mens) fancie, in affirming, <hi>that he might be fitly called, and was in deed the Biſhop of that one nation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And he is no leſſe deceived, in avouching, that <hi>the charge of that one Church or nation, was peculiarly allotted vnto him, i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mediately after</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Sect. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>Chriſts paſſion; or at least about the time of their generall disperſion from Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem:</hi> For, beſides that, theſe two cannot ſtand togither, (there being a good ſpace of time betwixt them, (as many appeare Act 1. 14. and 9, 27. and 11, 1. and 12, 2, 3.) he that deligenly obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the tenour of S. Lukes ſtorie, touching the ſtate and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church at Ieruſalem ſhall meet with many preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which ſtronglie argue, that for many yeares after Chriſts paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion Iames had no ſuch prerogative; eyther of ſuperioritie in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, above his fellowe Apoſtles; or of Superintendencie over the presbyters and people of that Church, as is thought to be annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his epiſcopall function.</p>
                     <p>The firſt act of note after Chriſtes aſcenſion, was the choyſe of Matthias into the roome of Iudas; wherein the text ſheweth, that Peter ſtood up in the middeſt of the Diſciples and propoſed the matter to the Aſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:14068:236"/> writers doe acknowledge, that Peter and not Iames had the preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie (Whitak: de Pont. pa. 288. Chamier de Oecum: pont. p. 431. Reynold Conf. cap. 4. Diviſ. 1.) 2. In like manner, on the day of Pentecoſt, after they had all received the Holy Ghoſte; Peter ſtanding with the eleven, lifted up his voice, (Acts. 2. 14.) and as the mouth of all, anſwered for all (ſee Chryſoſt: Oecum: &amp; Marlorat: on the place) to wype away that infamous ſlander of drunkenneſſe wherewith they were all charged. At which time he alſo poured forth thoſe gracious words of reprehenſion and exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, which gayned in that day 3000 ſoules to God, Act. 2. 22-41. 3. Within a while after, the taking a new occaſion to preach (Act. 3. 12.) had ſuch ſucceſſe, that many of his hearers imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the faith, (cap. 4. 4.) And this he did, when Iohn was in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie with him, (cap. 3. 1. 4. 11.) like as afterwards, when they both ſtood as priſoners, before the rulers of the Iewes; he ſo clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maynteined their innocencie, that they were both ſet at libertie (cap. 4. 8. 21. 4. Likewiſe, when the Apoſtles were (all at once) brought into queſtion, for their preaching Chriſt; Peter (as the prolocutor or cheife-ſpeaker) maketh the apologie for himſelfe &amp; the reſt. (cap. 5. 18. 27. 29.) 5. Moreover, when Ananias &amp; Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyra kept back part of the price of the poſſeſſion ſold, and layd downe the remaynder at the Apoſtles feet; their lying and diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, was diſcovered, and puniſhed, not by Iames, but by Peter: for at his word, they both fell downe dead, to the great terrour of all that heard the report thereof (cap. 5. 3-10.) If therefore this corporall puniſhment ſtood then in place of excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (as ſome affirme. See D. Dove, Def of Church-govern. pag. 21.) it will follow that (as before in preaching; ſo here alſo) in cenſuring of offenders, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is deemed one principall part of epiſcopal prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce) Peter as yet caried a greater ſtroke, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Iames or any other the Apoſtles, in the Church at Ieruſalem. 6.

Neyther did this drive him (after his delivera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce thereout) wholly to forſake Ieruſalem: for though for a time he went into an other place (cap. 12. 17.) yet repaired he thither againe; and was there, before the Synode that determined that controverſy mentioned chapt. 15. 7. Wherfore until this time (which was about 18. yeares after Chriſts paſſion; ſee D. Whitak. de pont. pag. 345) if any of the Apoſtles had any ſtanding preheminence above the reſt, eyther in the order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their meetings, or in the government of the Church of Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem; we haue better warrant to give it unto Peter; then the Do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> can alleadge for Iames or any other. So that if we ſhould take (as the D. doth) this ſuperioritie or ſuperintendencie for a ſufficient proofe of an epiſcopall function; wee might hence inferre that Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had it (and not Iames) at leaſt for 12. yeares after Chriſts paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, (ſee Doct. Whitak. vbi ſupra pag. 341) that is, till the ſecond yeare of Claudius the Emperour. But I purpoſe not to inforce any ſuch concluſion; it ſhall ſuffice from the former premiſſes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that S. Lukes ſtorie contradicteth their teſtimonie, which report Iames to be ordeyned by the Apoſtles (Peter Iames &amp; Iohn) Biſhop of Ieruſalem, imediately after Chriſts paſſion. For it were abſurd to think, that Peter ſhould conſecrate him to the office of a Biſhop in that Church, and reteyne in his owne hands (for ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares after ſuch conſecration) the cheefe power and prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, that is ſuppoſed to belong to that function. Wherefore, as the Refuter had reaſon to except againſt the Doctors evidence firſt alleadged, being altogither humane &amp; not divine: ſo I doubt not, but himſelfe will ſee, (if he wink not too hard) that he abuſeth the ſcriptures, which he cited to grace their teſtimonie on whom he principally relieth.</p>
                     <p>But to (paſſe forwards) let us now ſee what ſucceſſe the D. hath <note place="margin">Sect. 13. ad ſect. 4. pag. 31.</note> in anſwering the reſt of the refuters exceptions. And firſt that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which himſelfe ſetteth downe ſect. 4. p. 51. in this manner,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If the Apoſtles ordeyned Iames Biſhop of Ieruſalem; then they gave him the epiſcopall power. But they gave him no power, which the Lord had not before inveſted in his perſon, as an Apostle. Therefore they did not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyne him Biſhop.</hi> With the Doctrs leave I will change the aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and diſtinguiſh it from the confirmation thereof, which li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:14068:237"/> more cleare in the Refuters owne wordes (anſw. p. 131.) The argument therefore muſt ſtand thus, <hi>If the Apoſtles ordeyned Iames Biſhop of Ieruſalem; then they gave him the epiſcopall power. But they gave him not the epiſcopall power: Ergo, they did not ordeyn him Biſhop.</hi> The aſſumption as it now ſtandeth, is thus fortified;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The power of ordination and juriſdiction, was not given to Iames by the Apoſtles</hi> (for both were inveſted in his perſon, by the Lord himſelf; ſo as he being an Apoſtle might uſe eyther of them freely as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was offred, wherever he became.) <hi>But the epiſcopall power</hi> (in the Doctors underſtanding, form. pag. 32. 69. 73.) is the <hi>power of ordination and juriſdiction. Ergo, the epiſcopall power was not given to Iames by the Apoſtles.</hi> Now what is the D. anſwer? <hi>I anſwer</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>by distinction. The power of order, (if I may ſo terme it) Iames had before, as thoſe who are Biſhops ſine titulo: but the power of iuriſdiction was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was deſigned Biſhop of Ieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp;c.</hi> The edge of this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, is bent directly againſt the aſſumption of the Refuters ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection; and againſt the propoſition of the proſyllogiſm added for the confirmation thereof. Onely whereas the Refuter affirmeth, the power both of ordinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; of juriſdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be inveſted in the perſon of Iames by Chriſt, when he made him an Apoſtle (&amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neyther of them given him, by his fellow-Apoſtles) the Do: telleth us that Iames received fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt onely the power of order; but the power of juriſdiction was committed to him, when they deſigned him the Biſhop of Ieruſalem. So, in ſtead of power of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination &amp; power of juriſdiction, into which the Refuter diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all epiſcopall power (and that according to the Doctors own direction, as is before ſhewed) he now yeeldeth us a new diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of epiſcopall poewr, into power of <hi>order</hi> and power of <hi>juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction;</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The D. is driven to make new diſtributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> and yet utterly ſilenceth both the difference and the reaſon of the change; which a man that loveth plaine dealing ſhould not have done; eſpecially, when he hath to deale with ſuch, as are of a very ſhallow conceit; (as he ſaith, lib. 3. pag. 103.) for though they may from henceforth reſt perſwaded, that he confoundeth not the power of order in Biſhops, with their power of ordination; (becauſe he maketh the later, but a part of the former, (lib. 3. p. 102. 105.) yet they may ſtand in doubt, whether the power of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, which now he oppoſeth to the power of order, be the very ſame, that before he diſtinguiſhed from the power of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If the ſame; then his anſwer is both falſe and abſurd, yea
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:14068:238"/> contradicted by himſelfe.

                     <p>Againe, how often doth he tell us, that this power of juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (aſwell as that other of ordination) was derived vnto Biſhops from the Apoſtles, and that the Biſhops are their ſucceſſors in this power of government? ſerm. pag. 45. 70. and in this defence paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſim.) yea he ſaith, That the Apoſtles each of them, reteyned this power in their owne hands, whiles they continued neere vnto, or meant not to be long from the Churches, which they had plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and for proofe thereof, citeth, 2.

And if he ſhall ſay that the power of governm<hi rend="sup">t</hi> or juriſdiction, was incloſed in that Apoſtolicall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion, which they had from Chriſt (Mat. 18. 18. and 28. 19. Ioh. 20. 23. and 21. 15. 16.) is it not both falſe and abſurd, to deny that this power was inveſted in the perſon of Iames when he was made an Apoſtle? Now, if (to avoyd theſe inconveniences) he ſhall acknowledge that he taketh juriſdiction in an other ſenſe; his market is utterly marred; in aſmuch as he doth onely in ſhewe (to delude his reader) impugne that which his refuter affirmeth, whereas in deed he juſtifyeth him in his whole argument.

And if it be ſo as he ſaith, that Iames had power of juriſdiction given him by his fellowe-Apoſtles; when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned him Biſhop of Ieruſalem it will follow from hence. 3. that the Apoſtles gave him a power which themſelves had not: And 4. that thoſe Apoſtles which were not made Biſhops (as Iames was) never had that power of juriſdiction, which he enjoyed. Yea 5. the epiſcopall charge which Iames had at Ieruſalem, gave him a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence above his fellow-Apoſtles (not onely in ſuperioritie of order, while they remayned there; as before he affirmed; but alſo in power of juriſdiction. 6. And conſequently all other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops ordeyned by the Apoſtles, were in the like power ſuperior, to the very Apoſtles, as many as were not properly Biſhops. Theſe are the Doctors abſurdities, and the very naming of them, is ſufficient to abate the edge, and weaken the force of his anſwer: yea (under correction be it ſpoken) as it may well make him bluſh at the reading of his bragge (preface pag. 17.) where he ſaith, in his conſcience he is perſwaded, that no one of his proofes in all his ſermon is diſproved; nor he convinced of any one uintruth throughout the body thereof; ſo it may be a good motive to him, no longer to ſtrike, againſt the power of the truth; ſeing the anſwer which he hath framed to oppugne it, is not onely evill and abſurd; but (though perhaps againſt his will and meaning) giveth way unto it, for from his owne graunt, I thus argue to infringe that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, which he laboureth to confirme.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Whoſoever is ordeyned the Biſhop of any Church; he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the power of Epiſcopall order, from the handes that ordeyne

                     <p>But Iames received not the power of epiſcopall order from the handes of the Apoſtles. Ergo, neither was he ordeyned by them the Biſhop of any Church.</p>

                     <p>But Iames the Apoſtle by his deſignement to the charge of the Church at Ieruſalem received (in the Doctors opinion) onely the power of juriſdiction, to execute that power of order, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was inveſted in his perſon.</p>
                     <p>Therefore, he received no new function, by that deſignement. And conſequently, he was not ordeyned, to the function of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop in that Church.</p>
                     <p>To theſe arguments grounded on his owne anſwere, I add this that followeth, which the Doctor was willing not to ſee in the Refuters anſwere;</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Whoſoever by Chriſts ordination received all Miniſterial power, with ample authority to execute the ſame inall places whereſoever he became; he neyther did, nor could receive any new power (eyther of order or juriſdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) by a deſignement to the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight or care of any particular Church.</p>

For though he tell us, that <hi>Clement</hi> the Diſciple of the Apoſtles; doth call Iames the Biſhop of Biſhops, governing the Holy Church of the Hebrewes in Ieruſalem: yet (as if his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence tould him that his epiſtle was but a counterfeit) he addeth, But ſuppoſe that none of the Diſciples of the Apoſtles, in thoſe fewe writings of theirs which be extant, had given teſtimoney to this matter: were not the teſtimony of Egeſippus and Clement, who both lived in the very next age to the Apoſtles) ſufficient? No verily, their credit is too weake (as ſhalbe ſeen ſect. 17.) to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verweigh the preſumptions before alleadged, to ſhewe that Iames received no ſuch ordination from the Apoſtles, as the Doct. ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth for. It is therefore, but his vaine bragge, eaſier to be rejected then juſtifyed, to ſay as he doth, <hi>It is not to be doubted, but that Iames his being Biſhop of Ieruſalem, was a thing as notorious and as certeynly known among Chriſtians in thoſe times; as there is no doubt made among us now, that D. Cranmer was Archbiſhop of Canterburie in K. H. the 8. his time;</hi> For is it not rather much to be doubted of; ſeing that among all the writings that are extant, of Ignatius, Irenaeus, Tertullian and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry others in the firſt 300. yeares, the Doctor cannot find any one teſtimonie fit for his purpoſe. <hi>Rem adeo illustrem nullum habere auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem ſui ſeculi, aut ſecundi &amp;c. portento ſimile eſt.

For, doth not the D. meaſure the meaning of this phraſe by the line and levell of that large juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, which had no being in any Biſhop, for many hundred yeres after the Apoſtles, when he ſaith, <hi>that the Biſhop of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stantinople though called vniverſal Patriarch, yet was the Dioceſan Biſhop of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple alone; and that the Pope himſelfe though he clume to be vniverſall Biſhop, yet is specially Biſhop of Rome?</hi> Yet as if he were hired to wreſt this te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony out of their handes, that bend it againſt the Popes ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie; he telleth us, that in an edition of that epiſtle of Clement publiſhed by Sichardus at Baſil. anno 1526) he readeth thus, <hi>Sed et omnibus cecleſijs.</hi> which ſignifyeth that Clemens <hi>directed his epiſtle, not to Iames onely, but alſo to all Churches.</hi> But this is to corrupt the text by a falſe finger, for the former reading doth beſt agree with the title before given to Iames, <hi>Biſhop of Biſhops.</hi> And if Clement had meant to joyne any others with Iames in the inſcription of his epiſtle, he would (in all likelihood haue ſaid, ſed et omnibus e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopis per omnes eccleſias &amp;c. ſo joyning to him the Biſhops of other Churches; rather then the Churches themſelves.</p>

And if he (in his learning) judged it, for that reaſon; more ſafe to rely, upon the authenticall records of the Conncels &amp; Fathers, that were eye and eare-witneſſes of the thinges which he urgeth: had not the Refuter as good reaſon to deſire alſo to ſee Iames his ordination, juſtified by the teſtimonie of S. Luke, or ſome other Apoſtolike man that lived in that age?</p>

                     <p>2. <hi>But Euſebius</hi> (as the D. ſuppoſeth) <hi>is free from that imputation; and much more Hegeſippus &amp; Clemens.</hi> And is not Ierom as free as any other? belike the Doctor hath him in ſuſpition; though he be, <hi>all in all,</hi> in the evidence, that he produceth, as appeareth, ſerm. pa. 66. and 69. As for Euſebius, how free ſoever the Doctor judgeth him in this caſe, his teſtimonie ſtanding him in good ſtead; I ſuppoſe he wil not diſcharge him of that crime (of framing matters to his own conceit) in applying that which Philo wrote of the Iewiſh Eſſees, to Chriſtian Monks. lib. 2. Hiſt. eccleſ. cap. 17. whereof the reader may ſee Reynodes and Harts Conf. cap. 8. diviſ. 2. pag. 488. and 492.</p>
                     <p>3. Neither is it a cavill (as Mr D. in his quarrelling ſpirite is pleaſed to cenſure it) to ſay, <hi>that thoſe Fathers (Euſeb. Ierom &amp;c.) finding the name of Biſhop continued in the ſucceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of one Pastor after an other, iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of thoſe that first governed thoſe Churches, according to them that lived in their times.</hi> For if they ſpeake not improperly, (which the Doct. will not admit, for then he muſt yeeld himſelf to have played the ſophiſter) what elſe ſhould move them to aſcribe unto Peter, the place of a Biſhop at Rome, and that for 25. yeares co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuance? (ſee Euſeb. in Chron. and Ierom de ſcript. eccleſ. in Petro) unleſſe the Doctor had rather ſay of them, as one of great reading, doth of Euſebius in this point, (D. Reynolds Conf. with Hart. cap. 6. di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſ. 3. pag. 260-) viz. that the ſame befell them, which Thucidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des (Hiſt. lib. 1.) ſaith of the old ſtories of the Graecia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.

Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius fell upon it, and wrote it in his Chronicle: but if he had tried it by the touchſtone of the ſcripture, he would have caſt it off as counteryfeyt. Thus ſaith Doctor Reynolds of that matter; in like manner we may ſay without any wrong to Euſebius, (ſince we have before diſproved by good warrant from the ſcripture, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of his, concerning Iames his continuance for 30. yeares the Biſhop of Ieruſalem) that his deſire to magnify that See among others, made him alſo too c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>edulous in countenancing thoſe ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Egeſippus and Clemens, which by due examination, might have bene found unworthy of any credit.</p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:14068:241"/>
                     <p>For what probabilitie is there in Egeſippus his tale (apud Euſeb. <note place="margin">Sect. 3.</note> lib. 2. cap. 22.) concerning Iames? that he was a Nazarite from his mothers wombe, and never drunk wine (to grave the tale, he ſhould have excepted the times of partaking in the ſacrament of the Lords ſupper.) Moreover, that he abſteyned from eating of fleſh, from ſhaving his head; and from annointing his body with oyle, who would not take him by this deſcription, for a patterne of Monkiſh perfection, rather then of the epiſcopall function? ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſeing it is added, he was wont to enter alone into the temple, and ſpent there dayly ſo much time in prayer, that his knees, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meli inſtar, tuberculis contractis obduruerunt. Belike he forgat his Maiſters doctrine. Mat. 6. 6. Ioh. 4. 21. But the beſt is yet behind. Huic vni licebat in ſancta ſanctorum ingredi &amp;c, he only had liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to enter into the moſt holy place; for he uſed not any woollen garments; but onely lynnen: if this be true, then as he joyned a Biſhoprick to his Apoſtleſhip; ſo he had the high-preiſthood vnited to his Biſhoprick; unleſſe we may think the uſe of lynnen garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts to be a lawfull diſpenſation for any man that was no Preiſt, to u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurp the high-prieſts office in entring into the moſt holy place?</p>
                     <p>2. Now to come unto Clemens, how fabulous (I might ſay blaſphemous) is that which Euſebius (lib. 2. cap. 1.) reporteth out of him, <hi>that Chriſt after his reſurrection gave knowledge unto Iames the iust, to Iohn and Peter, and they delivered the ſame to the reſt of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles?</hi> For this tale is flatt repugnant (as Doctor Reynolds obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth. Conf. cap. 3. diviſ. 2. p. 163) to the word of truth: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we read that knowledge &amp; the holy Ghoſt, was given by Chriſt to all the Apoſtles joyntly. See we Luk. 24. 45. Iohn. 14. 26. and 16. 13. Act. 2. 4. and 4. 31. 2. Moreover, in this fable, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicteth himſelfe (like as lyars are wont to doe) forgetting what he had ſaid before; to wit, that it was an other Iames, &amp; not Iames the juſt, unto whom, togither with Peter and Iohn, Chriſt gave pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence above the reſt of the Apoſtles. 3. And ſince wee are now in hand, with the reputation of Clemens, and Egeſippus, the firſt reporters of Iames his Biſhoprick, (from whom, eyther at the firſt or ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d hand, the reſt of the witneſſes have received their war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant) it ſhall not be amiſſe, hither to drawe the examination, of the Doctors defence (pag. 60.) of their credit, againſt the moderate cenſure of the Refut: anſw. pag. 133. <hi>How unſavorie a speach</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is that of Clement (recorded by Euſebius (lib. 2. cap. 1.) that Peter
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:14068:241"/> Iames and Iohn, would not arrogate to themſelves that glorie (to have the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick of Ieruſalem) but choſe Iames the Iust unto it?</hi> Why? was it a <hi>greater glorie then their Apoſtleſhip? or can there be any lawfull calling in the Church too high for them, whom Christ vouchſafeth to make his Apoſtles; yea cheefe among the Apoſtles? Such speaches as this in the Fathers, are like black wenns in a faire body, that have more need of a cover for excuſe; then of ſetting out for commendation.</hi> The like may be ſayd of thoſe he calleth good Authors <hi>Euſebius and Egeſippus, who alleadge ſo carnall a respect of the Apoſtles in preferring Iames, and after him Simon, to that Biſhoprick, becauſe they were our Saviours kinſmen according to the fleſh.

But I would faine knowe, how he can deny him, an higher degree of Miniſterie, if that precedence in honour, which he aſcribeth to him, above his fellow-Apoſtles, aroſe from an other function (that is his Biſhoprick) which he alone injoyed? for I hope, he will grant the functions of an Apoſtle &amp; of a Biſhop, to be different degrees. And I ſuppoſe he knoweth, that among differing degrees (as Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons or Presbyters &amp;c.) the precedence of honour groweth from
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:14068:242"/> the higher degree, and not from the lower?

                        <hi>were not bound in respect of that love and reverence which they did owe to Chriſt, topreferre his neere kinſmen according to the fleſh, being at the leaſt equall with others?</hi> and addeth, <hi>that it is certeyne, that Iames for his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable piety was wonderfully honoured, &amp;c.</hi> Of this admirable piety, who doubteth? But wil that prove him, to be every way equal in all ſpiritual graces? The Apoſtle Iohn hath this title given him in holy writ; <hi>The Diſciple whom Ieſus loved,</hi> Iohn 13. 23. and 20. 2. &amp; 21. 20, 24. &amp; ſince the ground of his love was not kindred in the fleſh, ought we not to judge, it was ſome preheminence in true piety, or ſome other ſpirituall grace? It is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſaying and a true, <hi>Invidia virtutis comes eſt.</hi> Envie is the companion of vertue. Wherefore, ſeing the envie and malice both of Herod, and the reſt of the Iewes ſeazed upon that other Iames the brother of Iohn, Act. 12. 2. 3. that he became the firſt Martyr among the Apoſtles (as Steven was among the Deacons, Actes. 6. and 7.) is it not probable, that ſome preheminent grace occaſioned their malice to breake forth into ſuch extremitie? S. Peter, (who was at the ſame time im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned, like as he was before, cap. 4. 3. 8.) hath many titles of preheminence given him by the Fathers, which our owne divines (Sutcl: de pont. lib. 2. cap. 7. p. 123. Whit. de pont. queſt. 2. cap. 17. ſect. 2. pag. 316. D. Reynolds Conf. cap. 5. diviſ. 3. p. 224.) doe acknowledge to be in part, grounded upon an excellencie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the reſt in vertue and grace. For, Auguſtin (de Bapt. cont. Donatiſt. lib. 2. cap. 1.) ſaith, <hi>his primacie was conspicuous and prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent with excellent grace.</hi> And Euſebius (lib. 2. cap. 13.) calleth him, <hi>reliquorum omnium Apoſtolorum, propter virtutis amplitudinem, faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le principem.</hi> Wherfore, if the Doctors meaning be, to equall Iames, every wayes with his fellow-Apoſtles, in all ſpirituall grace, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorneth the function of a Miniſter of Chriſt; he muſt be beholding
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:14068:243"/> to his Reader, to take it upon his owne word, for it will be hard to make good proofe of it. But if he limit the equalitie he ſpeaketh of, to the power of the Apoſtolike function (which is all the equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity that he can with reaſon maintein:) he ſhall ſhew himſelfe too abſurd to avouch, that onely for kindred ſake vnto Chriſt; he was worthy to be preferred before the reſt; or that the Apoſtles were bound to be lead by this reſpect, in the diſtribution of eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call honours. This is in deed carnall divinity, and ſuch as argreeth not with the doctrine of Chriſt and his Apoſtles. Mat. 12. 48. 50. Iam. 2. 1. Act. 15. 9. 2. Cor. 5. 16. and 12. 5.</p>
                     <p>It might be asked, (if in reſpect of love and reverence to Chriſt the founder of the Church at Ieruſalem, it were neceſſarie to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre one of his kindred to the Biſhoprick thereof, before the reſt, that were otherwiſe equall:) whether the like reſpect ought not to haue place, in the choiſe of ſuch as were to ſucceed any of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles in the Churches which were founded by them, and in ſuch as are at this day, to ſucceed men of ſpecial reputation in any Church whatſoever? For, S. Paul teſtifieth, of Andronicus and Iunia (Ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 16. 7.) that they were his kinſmen, and fellow-priſoners; &amp; (which giveth them a ſingular note of preheminence above many others, they were <hi>epiſemoi en tois apoſtolois,</hi> famous or of ſpeciall note, among the Apoſtles, and before him, in Chriſt. Yet we never reade that they were preferred to a Biſhoprick, in any of the Churches (which were many) that Paul had founded. Is it not a ſhrewd preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he was ignorant of any ſuch preſident, ſince he had no care to walk by the ſame rule? Againe, may I ask M. Doctor, why Iames was not, aſwell before his election to his Biſhoprick as after; for the ſame reaſon honoured by his fellow-Apoſtles, with that precede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, which they gave him, when they made him a Biſhop? To conclude, if any ſuch primacie of honour above the reſt of the Apoſtles, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied Iames his ordination, to that ſuppoſed Biſhoprick; why ſhould it not, by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon conſent, be rather caſt upon one of thoſe, whom Chriſt preferred before the reſt? for were not all his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples bound, to give moſt honour to them, whom he moſt honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red? If then Peter, Iohn, and Iames the brother of Iohn, were by Chriſt preferred in honour, before his Iames (though for his pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie ſurnamed the Iuſt) was it not an injurie (I ſay not to them, but) even to Chriſt their Mr, in controwling that order of prehemine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, which he had ſet among his Apoſtles, to give one of their inferiors
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:14068:243"/> a place of dignitie above them? Wherfore, as the Refuter wronged not Clemens or Egeſippus, in charging the ſpeach of the one to be <hi>vnſavourie,</hi> and the reſpect alleadged by the other to be <hi>carnall:</hi> ſo it is no injurie to Euſebius (who buildeth vpon their reportes) to ſay, he was too <hi>credulous,</hi> in interteyning for truth upon their words, that which upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> due examination, appeareth unworthy of any cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. And the ſame, is the fault of the reſt, which in later time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any further ſearch, gave credit vnto their teſtimony. Which ſottiſh imitation (as one Mr. Bell calleth it, epiſt. before his tryall of new religion, pag. 1. Survey of popery. part-3. cap. 7. &amp; pag. 342.) if it were the cauſe of many errors, even in matters of doctrine, (as is for inſtance ſhewed in the errour of the Chiliaſts) I ſee no reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie, why it might not alſo be a cauſe of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny errors, in matters of fact or hiſtorie. Yet the Refuter did (and ſo doe I ſtill) ſo farre tender their eſtimation, that wee withdraw not any aſſent from their report; but when there is better warrant, (ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of ſcripture or ſound reaſon) leading another way.</p>
                     <p>Now whereas the Refuter ſaith, <hi>that Iames neyther was properlie</hi>

(to make him odious with his Reader) replieth, <hi>that he giveth all his witneſſes the lie.</hi> But (though he be a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor he uſeth a falſe finger to juſtify his ſuggeſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, thruſting out the word <hi>properly</hi> (which the Refuter inſerted. pag. 132. of his anſw.) and charging him to ſay plainly, <hi>that Iames was not Biſhop of Ieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, not could be.</hi> It is plaine, (and the Doctor acknowledgeth it) that the Refuter here denieth vnto Iames, he doth it (not ſo much of himſelfe as) from the mouth of ſome late writers of worthy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, D. Whitakers, D. Reynoldes, Biſhop Iewell and others. In charging him therefore to give his witneſſes the lie; what elſe doth he, but through his ſides, wound their credit; ſeing the fault (if any) ligteth on their heads. But the truth is, neyther he nor they doe oppoſe the former denaill to the teſtimonie of the fathers; but to their aſſertion, which from the name of a Biſhop, given to Iames or Peter, in the writings of the Fathers, doe inferre that Iames or Peter, were properly Biſhops. For the Refuter (in his wordes imediately before going) ſaith, <hi>that the Fathers might will call Iames, by the name of a Biſhop, which then was of greatest dignitie; ſeing it is certeyne he had, (though an higher, yet) the ſame place in Ieruſalem, that afterwards Biſhops claimed and poſſeſſed in other Churches.</hi> And elſewhere (anſwere
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:14068:244"/> pag. 143.) he explaineth his judgment more plainely in the words of Doctor Whitakers (de pont. pag. 303.) who ſaith; <hi>that when the Fathers call Iames or Peter a Biſhop, they take not the name of Biſhop pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, but call them Biſhops of thoſe Churches, in which they aboad ſomewhat long, &amp;c.</hi> I now adde the words of D. Reynolds (Conf. with Hart Cap. 4. diviſ. 2.) becauſe the Doctor to finding the place quoted, thought his name was uſed onely for a ſhewe: concerning Iames, he ſaith, <hi>that he which maketh him a Biſhop of one citie, whom Chriſt made an Apostle to all the nations of the earth, bringeth him out of the hall (as they ſay,) into the kitchin.</hi> And in anſwer to Chryſoſtome, (alleadged by Stapleton, and Hart, (as he is by the D.) to confirme his ſuppoſed Biſhoprick) he addeth. <hi>It ſeemeth he ſpake it vpon the word of Clemens</hi> apud Euſeb: lib. 2. cap. 1.) And when Hart ſayth, <hi>he ſhould not help him with ſuch ſhifts againſt the Fathers,</hi> he replieth, <hi>neyther ſhifts, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the fathers; but true defenſes in favour of them.</hi> For the Apoſtles <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſent to preach the goſpel to all nations, made their chiefe aboad in greatest cities of moſt reſort, as at Ieruſalem, Antioch, Epheſus, Rome &amp;c. now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this reſidence, in the mother cities, was afterwards ſupplyed by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of them; therefore were the fathers wont to call the Apoſtles, Biſhops of thoſe cities, wherein they aboad moſt; which they might the rather for that the word epiſcope, in their speach, to wit Euſeb. &amp; (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>emens) betokeneth in a generall meaning, any charge or overſight of others &amp;c.</hi> It is plain then, that the Doctor (in his former wordes) giveth his tongue and pen libertie to run out, beyond the bounds of truth. 1. In carrying unto his witneſſes (&amp; to impugne their teſtimonie) that which was intended onely to contradict his owne poſition. 2. in conſtruing that to be meant of an abſolute denyall of the name of a Biſhop, which was ſpoken of the epiſcopall function, properly taken, for that which now beareth the name. The reader therefore is to be advertiſed, that although the Refuter indeavoured, (by ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s againſt the Doctors witneſſes) to ſhew that their teſtimony is too weak, to bind the conſcience to enterteyne their report, for an undoubted truth: yet he is ſo farre from giving them all, the lie (as the Doctor not very chriſtianly chargeth him), that treading in the ſtepps of many other worthies) he ſalveth their credit, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing the ſpeciall &amp; proper ſignification of the word Biſhop, from that which is more generall and improper. For properly in the phraſe of the Apoſtle, 1. Tim. 3, 1, 2. Tit. 1. 7. it noteth him, who by his function is limited and faſtened to the perpetuall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:14068:244"/> of one particular Church: and now (in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſpeach it is appropriated to the function of a Dioceſan Prelate; but in a more generall conſtruction, as the Apoſtleſhip is called <hi>epiſcope</hi> a Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like-charge: ſo the Apoſtles were by the Fathers termed Biſhops. And ſome of them, (as Iames and Peter) vvere ſAid to be Biſhops of thoſE Churches, wherein they were reported to have made their longeſt reſidence.</p>
                     <p>And that the Fathers doe uſe the word in this latter conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Refuter judgeth it moſt probable; becauſE he is perſwaded (not without good reaſon) that (in the former ſignification) Iames being an Apoſtle, neyther was nor could be a Biſhop. So then, if the Doctor (who holdeth Iames to be properly a Biſhop, yea a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oceſan Biſhop in function like to ours) will juſtifie his aſſertion by thoſe fathers whom he alleadgeth, ought he not to haue demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated (that which he wholly overpaſſeth, to wit) that the Fathers which entitle Iames the Biſhop of Ieruſalem, meane thereby, that he had proper function of a dioceſan Biſhop? But he thinketh it ſufficient, to remove the grounds which his Refut: layd to make good his deniall, let us therefore come to it.</p>
                     <p>The Refuter ſaith, that Iames neyther was nor could be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly <note place="margin">Sect. 7.</note> a Biſhop, ſeing he continued in the Apoſtleſhip a diſtinct of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice from it; The D. anſwereth, that <hi>none of his authors were ſo ſimple, but they knew aſwell as the refuter that Iames was an Apostle; neyther knew they any reaſon, which the Reſ: would ſeem to know, why his being an Apoſtle ſhould binder his being the Apostle or angel of that Church; for ſo were the Bps at the firſt called.</hi> Yet with his leave, ſome of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were ſo ſimple, that they thought this Iames (called by Paul the L. brother) was the ſonne of Ioſeph, by an other wife, before he was eſpouſed to Marie the mother of Chriſt. (ſee Euſeb. lib. 2. ca. 1. Cent. 1. lib. 2. cap. 10. col. 579. vbi dicitur Epiphanius idem ſentire) which is in effect to denie him to be one of the 12. whom Chriſt ſelected to that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Apoſtleſhip.

For having ſaid, that Peter and Paul were both Apoſtles and Biſhops in Rome; he ſaith withall. (Haereſ. 27.) that there were other Biſhops whiles they lived, becauſe the Apoſtles went often into other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, to preach Chriſt; and the City of Rome might not be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Biſhop. What can be more playne to ſhewe, that ſince the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of an Apoſtle requireth traveile abroad into diverſe countries to preach Chriſt; and the office of a Biſhop bindeth to attendance at home, on that one Church, wherof he is made an overſeer; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and Apoſtle cannot be properly a Biſhop. Let me therefore here ſay to the Doctor, (as Doctor Reynolds did to Mr. Hart, Conf. cap. 6. Diviſ. 3. ad finem <hi>(you may learne by the Fathers themſelves, that when they termed any Apoſtle a Biſhop, of this or that citie, they meant it in a generall ſort and ſignification, becauſe he attended that Church for a time, and ſupplied that roome in preaching of the goſpell, which Biſhops afterwards did.</hi> And if this ſatiſfy not the Doctor, let him goe roundly to work; and prove by other parts of their writings who are his wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes in this queſtion of Iames his Biſhoprick; that Iames his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in the function of an Apoſtle, was no hindrance to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving and holding of a Biſhopr, properly ſo called. In the mean while let us paſſe on to the new writers which concurre with the Refuter, not onely in denying Iames, to be properly a Biſhop; but alſo in that more generall aſſertion; that an Apoſtle could not be a Biſhop properly.</p>

Peters Biſhoprick at Rome) the like evidence may be produced; neyther doth the Doctor hold it any haynous crime in himſelfe; by his deniall, to overweigh their teſtimonie. 2. Notwithſtanding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is not the opinioin of Doctor Whitakers, or any other, which the Refuter co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendeth to the D. conſideration; but the reaſons rather, whereby their judgement is ſwayed. For as he ſaith (anſw. pag. 132.) the ſame arguments that prove Peter might not be Biſhop of Rome, are as effectuall to conclude, that Iames might not be Biſhop of Ieruſalem; ſeing they were both equall in the Apoſtleſhip. And what though it were ſo,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:14068:246"/> as the Doctor ſaith, (ſect. 6. pag. 55.) that 6. of thoſe 8. argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which Doctor Whitakers (de pont. queſt. 3. ca. 3. ſect. 9.) urgeth, be <hi>ſuch as the Refuter with all his ſophrist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ie cannot with any ſhew of truth apply to S. Iames?</hi> If the other two be ſuch; as the Doctor withall his ſophiſtry cannot with any ſhew of truth exe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt S. Iames from their reach; is it not ſufficient to give him the foile in the maine controverſie now in hand? Yet there are ſome things avou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched for the removall of thoſe 6. arguments, which are already ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently diſproved; as that he ſaith, the ſtorie of the Acts doth te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify S. Iames his ſtanding reſidence at Ieruſalem, and that his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedence (in honour) before Peter and Iohn, is noted, Gal. 2. 9. And ſomethings doe rather make againſt him, then for him. For if he were the Apoſtle of the Iewes at large (as may be truely ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from his epiſtle written to the 12. tribes that were ſcattered abroad, (Iam. 1. 1.) and that compact made between paul and him, with Peter and Iohn, Gal. 2, 9.) how was he properly the Bp. of the Ch: at Ieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? For as it was fit, that Peter ſhould have profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Gentiles to be his charge; if he had bene their Biſhop at Rome: ſo it had bene no leſſe fit, that Iames ſhould have profeſſed himſelfe to have bene the Apoſtle or Biſhop of the Iewes in Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem: or at leaſt in Iurie; if he had bene by Peter and Iohn, confined to that one Church or Province.</p>
                     <p>Againe, if he can for his advantage (I meane, to juſtify his deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of Peters Biſhoprick at Rome) carry the words of all the Fathers that ſay he was Biſhop there, to this meaning that he was one of the founders of that Church; may not his Refuter (in defence of his deniall of Iames his Biſhoprick at Ieruſalem) take the like liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in conſtruing the Doctors witneſſes, to this meaning, that he taught and governed that Church for the time of his reſidence there? If the Refuter in denying the later, give all the D. witneſſes the lie; ſhall the Doctor goe free from the like blame of giving the lie to many ancient Fathers in denying the former? Let him ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take home his owne words (cap. 2. pag. 46.) See, ſee <hi>homo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini quantum praeſtat;</hi> that is ſtrong in his hand, which were weak in an others; the truth belike is ſo partiall, that it is true onely in his mouth.</p>
                     <p>But joyn we now in iſſue with him, in the triall of the 2. firſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whether they will not conclude with the Refuter that Iames <note place="margin">Sect. 2. ad ſect. 7. pag 57.</note> was not properly the Biſhop of Ieruſalem. The reaſon is thus fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

For when they were directed to goe, ſome into one part and ſome to an other, had they then every one his peculiar Church aſſigned to them? and were they bound to feed the ſame as every Biſhop is to attend his owne flock? I ſuppoſe the Doctor dareth not affirme it; he rather yeeldeth the contrarie, in ſaying, <hi>they ceaſed to traveile in their old dayes; and then were reputed Biſhops of that place, where they reſted.</hi> Well, did they all traveile till they were old? and is that the time whereunto his diſtinction of times referreth us, for the aſſigning
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:14068:247"/> of Churches vnto them? Not ſo neyther; for he ſaith, <hi>Iames did not traveile at all as the reſt, from one country to another.</hi> So then, howſoever he maketh a ſhew of anſwering by a diſtinction of times; yet indeed, the very marrow and pith of his anſwere, is by a difference in the perſons, to contradict the aſſumption: and to give Doctor Whita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers the lie (if I may uſe the Doctors owne homely phraſe) for in plaine termes he ſaith, <hi>herein Iames differeth from the reſt; for to him at the firſt before their diſperſion, the Church of Ieruſalem, was aſſigned.</hi> And againe, <hi>the aſſumption therefore, which is true of the reſt of the Apoſtles, is not true in Iames; and were to be denied, If the ſyllogiſme, were thus framed.

This aſſumption (ſaith he) I have diſproved.</hi> But the beſt is, his diſproofe of this aſſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (though he hath proportioned it alſo to his owne ſtrength) is ſufficiently declared to be nothing worth: For he neyther hath nor can prove, that nay, much leſs many ancient Fathers, as he hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged, doe affirme Iames to be a Biſhop in that ſenſe which he imbraceth; ſc. properlie a Biſhop, and ordeyned to that function, by his fellow-Apoſtles. But it ſhall not be amiſſe for the Reader to obſerve the Doctors cunning in changing the Medius terminus of <note place="margin">The Doct. cun<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ingly changeth the medius terminus of the obj:</note> the objection, which he undertaketh to anſwere. And ſince he will have it ſpecially fitted to Iames, I will do it, and ſo leave it to all indifferent judgment, whether it hold not in Iames aſwell as in Peter. <hi>Every Biſhop hath one onely flock, to which he is affixed, to feed it as his owne.</hi>

                     <p>I hope the Doctor will not ſay, he hath diſproved this aſſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">Section 3.</note> as it now ſtandeth: for this cannot be diſproved without proofe made of the contrary, ſc. that Iames had one onely flock aſſigned to him, and was affixed to it or bound to attend on the feeding thereof.

And if he meane (in his next) to make it good, firſt let him tell us, which was that one onely flock that was aſſigned to him. Here he ſaith it was the Church of Ieruſalem; and his proofes from the Fathers, make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of no other; yet elſwhere (pag. 56.) he ſaith, <hi>it is more then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that the Church of Iurie, was peculiarly aſſigned to him;</hi> and (p. 52.)
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:14068:247"/> he coupleth both togither, ſaying, <hi>that the Apoſtles would not all forſake Iurie and Ieruſalem; but aſſigned one of their owne companie to take charge therof.</hi> And in the words i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mediately following, he ſaith, <hi>he was aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the peculiar Church of one nation; and therefore was in deed the Biſhop therof;</hi> which argueth the whol body of the people of the Iewes, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well thoſe that were ſcattered in other countryes (to whome he wrote his epiſtle) as the Inhabitantes of Iurie, to be his peculiar charge: vnleſs he ſpeak improperly, in taking the whol for a part onely. If therefore the Doctor will ſay, that Iames had one onely flock aſſigned to him; let us know whether the whol nation or the province of Iudea onely, or rather the dioceſe, (for I know, he will not ſay, it was the pariſh Church) of Ieruſalem; I give him this choiſe, ſo be that he will be conſtant in that he chooſeth, and not hover up and down as he doth, not knowing (as it ſeemeth) where to reſt. The firſt is ſo repugnant to the teſtimony of Saint Paul, who teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth Gal. 2. 9. that Peter and Iohn joyned with him in the charge of the Iewiſh nation, that I think he will be aſhamed to ſtand forth in defenſe of it. And if he will mainteyne the ſecond; he muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime to the world, ſome prerogatives more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ever were knwon in former ages) which this Church had above all other Churches. For whereas the Churches planted in other Mother cities, were at the firſt but Dioceſes, (in the Doctors perſwaſion) and by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination of ſeverall Dioceſes, in one Province, each of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a provinciall Church: this contrarywiſe, was, at her firſt eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing, and bringing into order a province; and upon the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying of Churches in Iudea; it was diſtributed into ſundry Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſes. And whereas other Churches had presbyters, before they had any Biſhop; this had a Biſhop who was actually a provinciall prelate, before there were any, eyther presbyters inthe Dioceſe, or Dioceſan Bps in the Province; which later is contrary to his Tenent in this defence often avouched. (lib. 2. pag. 114. lib. 3. pag. 20. lib. 4. pag. 7.) viz. that the Biſhops of Mother cities, were origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally but Dioceſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; not actually Metropolita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s; till other ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:14068:248"/> ſince Peter beſtowed great paynes that waye in diverſe parts of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea, for many yeares after the diſperſion of the reſt of the Apoſtles; (as is before ſhewed from Lukes ſtorie, cap. 5. ſect. 11. 12.) it vvill be hard for the Doctor to prove, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>to feed as his owne peculiar charge.</hi> And now if he will deny the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of this argument, I muſt recall him to the fortifications before mencioned. The firſt concludeth the pointes neceſſarily &amp; inevitablie in this manner;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Whoſoever were by Chriſt commanded, to goe into all the world, to preach the gospell and to make diſciples; and being mindfull of their imbaſſage did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their charge; they had not, (any of them) one onely flock unto which they were bound, to feed the ſame as their owne.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>But all the Apoſtles, were by Chriſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded to goe into all the world, to preach the gospell and to make diſciples; and they all being mindfull of their Embaſſage, did according to their charge.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>None of the Apostles therefore, had one onely flock, to which they were bound, to feed it as their own.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The propoſition, is of it ſelfe cleare enough. The aſſumption, for the firſt part of it; as it is grounded on the wordes of Chriſt, Mat. 28. 19. Mark. 16. 15. ſo it is acknowledged by the Doctor; and we doe allow his interpretation of their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion (pag. 51. line penult. and 57. line 6.) viz. that Chriſts meaning was not, that every one ſhould traverſe the whole world: yet their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:14068:248"/> was indefinite and without any aſſignement of provinces or parts of the world to any. Now, if he make queſtion of the latter part of the Aſſumption, I referre him to that which is obſerved, (cap. 5. ſect. 10.) out of Mark, 16. 20; and I wiſh him to be wel adviſed, leaſt he be found to give that Evangeliſt the lie; if he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt Iames from that obedience to Chriſts charge, which he teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth of all without exception, viz. that (as Chriſt had before com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded ſo) they went all forth, and preached every where. For who ſhall dare without good warrant, to reſtreyn the generall ſenſe of the holy Ghoſt, in the one more then in the other? Either ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, let Iames be exempted from partaking with his fellowes in their Apoſtolicall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion; or let him partake with them in the praiſe which is given them, for obeying the charge which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. If he will needes exempt S. Iames from preaching every where as the reſt did, (that is to ſay, here and there in diverſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, or countries, without reſtreynt to any one) becauſe Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius and others ſay, that Iames had the charge of Ieruſalem, and governed the Church there: then let him alſo except S. Iohn, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither with Thomas and Andrew; becauſe Euſebius ſaith, (lib. 3. cap. 1.) that (in the diſtribution of the world among the Apoſtles) Thomas obteyned Parthia, Andrew, Scythia, and Iohn, Aſia. But though he confine Iames to Ieruſalem (or at leaſt to Iurie) yet of the reſt he ſaith, they were not confined to any one province; but traveyled from one country to an other. To come then to the 2. fortification, it argueth alſo uncontroulablie in this ſort; <hi>None that knewe they ought alwayes to follow the direction of the holy Ghoſt, and to goe forthwith whither ſoever he ſhould call them, might have their ſeates faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to one certeyne place or flock.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>But all the Apoſtles knew, that they ought alwayes to follow the direction of the holy Ghoſt, and to goe forthwith, whither ſoever he ſhould call them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Therefore, none of the Apostles might have their ſeates faſtned to one certeyne place or flock.</hi> And conſequently, none of them had one onely flock, on which he was bound continually to attend; For it were a wrong to them to thinke, that they or any of them would doe, that which they knewe was not lawfull for them to doe.</p>

                        </gap>ion, I ſuppoſe the Doctor will take no exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption; and if he ſhall pick any quarrel againſt the aſſumption; he muſt ſay, eyther in generall that none, or in particular that ſome, and namely Iames knewe no ſuch dutie that they did owe to God,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:14068:249"/> as to attend alwayes on his call and direction for the imployment of their miniſteriall paines. If the former; let him conſider what is already ſaid (cap. 5. ſect. 11.) to ſhewe that the Apoſtles had not before their diſperſion, each of them his ſeverall circuite, meaſured out to him once for all, by the directio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the holy Ghoſt as he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth. For ſince they were to wayt for the holy Ghoſts direction whither to goe; (as the Doctor acknowledgeth pag. 57.) if they had not their whole line or compaſſe layd out at once; muſt they not of neceſſitie, remaine alwayes ready, to goe, whither ſoever God by his ſpirit ſhould call them? And if this be apparant in any one: (as it is in Paul, Act. 13. 2. 4. &amp; 16. 6. 10. and 18. 9. 11. &amp; 19. 21.) ought we not to judge the like of all? For why ſhould any one Apoſtle be freed from that attendance, which another is tied unto, and that for the performance of his Apoſtolicall function? And when the Doctor ſtretcheth in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon unto all the Apoſtles, (pag. 52.) that which Paul ſpeaketh of himſelfe; and ſuch as aſſiſted him within his Apoſtolicall line; doth he not aſſume it for an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted truth, that in the execution of their Miniſterie, they all walked by one rule? It were abſurd therefore here to except Iames fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall attenda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the holy Ghoſts direction, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto his fellow-Apoſtles were bound. And conſequently abſurd to give him one onely flock, and to affixe him for his whole life, to the ſervice thereof; when the reſt were bound alvvayes to be ready to goe, whither ſoever the holy Ghoſt ſhould direct them.</p>
                     <p>Thus much for the juſtifying of the firſt reaſon, againſt Peters <note place="margin">Sect. 5. ad ſect. 7. pag. 58.</note> Biſhoprick; the ſecond reaſon againſt it, is thus applyed by the D. (pag. 58) unto Iames, <hi>If Iames were Biſhop; then by the ſame reaſon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Apoſtles were Biſhops: But the other Apoſtles were not Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops properly; Therefore not Iames.</hi> The Doctor ſhould have added D. Whitakers concluſion, and applied it to Iames in this ſort,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If none other Apostle had his ſeat fixed to any certeyne place; then neither had Iames his ſeat fixed to Ieruſalem. But none other Apoſtles had his ſeat fixed to a certeyne place. Ergo, neyther had Iames his ſeat fixed to Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi> The Doctors anſwer is, that he hath ſhewed ſufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why he ſhould not graunt the conſequence, in ſetting downe the difference between Iames, and the reſt of the Apoſtles. But are the differences ſuch as he can and will mainteyne, that they neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily argue the one to be properly a Biſhop; and the reſt nor? o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they neyther are, nor can be a ſufficient reaſon of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:14068:249"/> of the coſequence. Let us therfore peruſe them. Firſt, he ſaith, <hi>that Iames herein differeth from the reſt; that to him at the firſt, the Church of Ieruſalem was aſſigned.</hi> I anſwer, that an aſſignement to the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of one Church; maketh not a Biſhop, unleſſe he be alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined unto it alone, and that for perpetuitie. But the Doctor can never prove that Iames was ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fined to the charge of the Church of Ieruſalem. Moreover we have better evidence for Pauls aſſigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to the Church of Corinth; (Act. 18. 9. 10. 11. 1. Cor. 9. 2. &amp; 2. Cor. 10. 13.) then can be alleadged for Iames his aſſigneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to Ieruſalem: And (if we may beleeve the D.) he telleth us (pag. 52.) that at what time Iames was aſſigned to Ieruſalem; the reſt were aſſigned alſo, to their circuite, one to one part and an other to an other. This firſt difference therefore, is eyther none at all, or not ſuch as can give the function of a Biſhop to the one; and deny it to all the reſt. Secondly the Doctor addeth, <hi>that Iames did not tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veile as the rest from one country to an other, being not confined to one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.</hi> But it is ſhewed in the former ſection, that Iames was neyther confined to Ieruſalem, nor debarred from traveil abroad; and that the grounds whereon the Doctor buildeth, will confine ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to certeine countryes (as Thomas to Parthia, Andrewe to Scythia, and Iohn to Aſia,) no leſſe then Iames to Ieruſalem. And let me aske him, what proofe he can make (worthy of credit) that Matthew, Matthias and Iames (that was martyred at Ieruſalem, Act. 12. 2.) ſpent their daies in traveil fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one country to an other? And if Iames be to reckoned a Biſhop, becauſe he reſted at Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, when others traveiled from place to place; why he ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the reſt to be alſo properly Biſhops, when they took up ſome ſpeciall place to reſt in, as he ſayth, Iohn did at Epheſus &amp;c. ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſeing the fathers intitle them Biſhops of thoſe places where they reſted. Thirdly, an other difference he noteth. ſcz. that <hi>wheras the other Apoſtles having planted Churches, when they ſawe their time, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the ſame to certeine Biſhops yet Iames co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted the Church of Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem to no other.</hi> But can he tell us, to what Biſhops the Churches of Iconium, Lyſtra, Derbe, Antioch in Piſidia, and ſundry others planted by Paul, were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted. For why ſhould not he be the Biſhop of thoſe Churches, which being planted by him, received no other Biſhop to governe them; if this reaſon proveth Iames to be the Biſhop of Ieruſalem? The conſequence therefore of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument aboveſayd is nothing weakned by the differences, which
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:14068:250"/> the Doctor putteth betwene Iames and the reſt of the Apoſtles as he affirmeth. Notwithſtanding, that the reader may ſee, how groſſely he erreth in combyning theſe two functions (of an Apoſtle &amp; a Biſhop) in one perſon I will here propoſe ſome of the reaſons, which D. Sutlif (a zealous mainteyner of the epiſcopall governme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t) hath preſſed againſt Peters ſuppoſed Biſhoprick at Rome. De pont lib. 2. cap. 10.</p>

As for thoſe Fathers which ſay, that Iames was by his fellow-Apoſtles ordeyned Biſhop of Ieruſalem, we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready (Cap. ſect. 22.) heard Doctor Sutliffs anſwer, this onely now I add that the Doct. cannot without contradiction to himſelf take it for ordination to the function of a Biſhop; ſeing he ſaith, that Iames receyved the epiſcopall power of order from Chriſt as Biſhops ſine titulo, as is alſo before ſhewed cap. 5. ſect. 13. 14.</p>
                     <p>3. <hi>The office of Biſhops is farre inferior to the office of Apostles and after a ſort included in it; for the Apostles ordeyned Biſhops &amp; heard their cauſes &amp;c.

                        </gap> of all the reſt, Iames his ſhare muſt needs be by farr the leaſt, if he were confined to the charge of one onely Church. Yea this is in deed to make him no Apoſtle, or at leaſt a Titular Apoſtle onely; for as he ſaith of <hi>titular</hi> Biſhops. lib. 3. pag. 130.) that they were ſuch as had the bare name, but not the authority of a Biſhop: ſo he muſt alſo affirme of Iames, that he was but a titular Apoſtle; ſeing th' au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of an Apoſtle (which ſtandeth in preaching to all nations as occaſion ſhalbe offred; and in planting Churches, where none were &amp;c.) is denied unto Iames; if his whole authoritie be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the epiſcopall overſight of that Church of Ieruſalem, which was already founded to his hand. And if it were a puniſhment to Meletius, and others which returned from ſchiſme or haereſy to the Church, to debarre them from their epiſcopall authoritie; though they were allowed the name or title of Biſhops; how ſhould it be an inlargement of Iames his honour; to haue his whole authority confined to one Church, (as other Biſhops) although he reteyned the name and title of an Apoſtle?</p>
                     <p>As for the next point (viz. Iames his continuance at Ieruſalem <note place="margin">Sect. 9. ad ſect. 9. pag 62. Doct. &amp; Refuter pag. 134.</note> for; o yeares, even till his dying day) to omit what is already ſayd (cap. 5. ſect. 10. &amp; 25.) for the contrary; we are now to examine, whether the cauſe of his ſtay there, was (as the Doctor ſuppoſeth onely to governe that Church, in the function of a Biſhop? The reaſon of his continuance there (ſaith the refuter) <hi>was not ſo much the ruling of the Chriſtians, that were converted (which might have bene other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe performed) as the converting of multitudes, both of Iewes and of other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that vſually flocked thither, which was a work of the Apostolicall fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi>
                        <pb n="91" facs="tcp:14068:252"/> Wherevnto the Doctor replyeth, <hi>that it is nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to ſay the Church might have bene otherwiſe governed; vnleſſe he could ſhewe that it was otherwiſe governed.</hi> But he is to be advertiſed, that if he graunt it might have been otherwiſe governed without an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles reſidence there; then he ſhall ſhew himſelf verie voide of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to make the government of that Church, eyther the onely or the principall cauſe, of his ſo long remayning in that place. And vnleſs he can aſſigne ſome other cauſe of more weight, then that the Refuter mencioneth; it is but a wrangling part in him; to make a ſhew of refuting his Refuters aſſertion, in this caſe. Neyther is it any thing to the purpoſe, to urge him to ſhew that the church of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem was otherwiſe governed; vnleſſe he had denied that the chiefe ſtroke of the government, reſted in his handes for the time of his aboad there, after the diſperſion of the reſt of the Apoſtles into other parts.</p>
                     <p>And where he ſayth, <hi>There is no doubt, but that Church had a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor aſſigned to them by the Apostles &amp;c.</hi> eyther he doth but trifle; or (which is worſe) diſſembleth his owne knowledge; for if by a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, he meane a Dioceſan Biſhop, he knoweth very well, that it is not onely doubted of; but flatly denyed, that any ſuch Paſtor was aſſigned to them by the Apoſtles. But if he take the word at large, for every or any one that feedeth (whether as Peter Iohn 21. 15. in the function of an Apoſtle; or as the Biſhops of Epheſus in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie calling of Presbyters, Act. 20. 28.) then he ſheweth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a meer trifler; ſince it nothing advantageth his cauſe to grant, that Iames was (in this large conſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the word) their Paſtor, by a temporary aſſignment; and that beſides him, they had other Paſtors, even ſo many as there were presbyters in that Church. But when he ſaith, <hi>there is no doubt to be made,</hi> but the cauſe and end <note place="margin">The Doct. beggeth.</note> of <hi>his staying there 30. yeares, was the ſame, with the cauſe of the ſtay of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and the reſt of his ſucceſsors till their death:</hi> he doth too apparant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begg the queſtion. For the cauſe which the Refuter propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (and the Doctor contradicted not) ceaſed before Simons electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Biſhoprick of Ieruſalem; for his election was not till Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem was deſtroyed by Titus as Euſebius affirmeth, lib. 3. ca. 10. Wherefore, there was no ſuch recourſe, eyther of Iewes or of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nations unto the Temple there in Simons time, or his ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors; as was all the dayes of Iames. And ſince the time of the Iewes rejection; for the generality of them, took place, after that deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:14068:253"/> made by Titus &amp; his army; there was not the like need (now as before) for one of the Apoſtles there to reſide to labour the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Ergo, neyther was the charge which Iames had, the charge of a Biſhop, but of an Apostle.</hi> Now what anſwer maketh the Doct. in his defenſe?

Doth he contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict the aſſumption, and ſay, that the Apoſtles whiles they gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned joyntly the Church of Ieruſalem, had the charge not of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, but of Biſhops, in the very function of Dioceſan Biſhops: ſuch as he ſuppoſeth Iames and his ſucceſſors to be? no; for then he ſhould throttle his owne anſwer to Doct. Whitakers firſt argument (pag. 57.) where he flatly denieth any of the Apoſtles (Iames ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) to be properly Biſhops. And by his diſtinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the times, (both here and page 52) he playnly ſignifyeth that the indefinite commiſſion of the Apoſtles to goe into all the world, received no limitation, till by the Holy Ghoſts direction, they diſperſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſome into one part of the world, and ſome into an other. What then? When plaine dealing will not help; an aequivocating anſwer muſt ſerve the turne. <hi>As though (ſaith he) the charge of the Apoſtles, is not by the Holy Ghoſt, called epiſcope (Act. 1. 20.) that is, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick.

Phil. 1. 1.) when it is applyed to ſuch as had the ſtanding charge of one Church; or in the Doctors underſtanding, when the name of Biſhop, or Biſhoprick is given to Iames and his ſucceſſors. And as though Iames did not receive a great change, in regard of his charge and functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when being at the firſt an Apoſtle abſolutely, he was made
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:14068:253"/> the Biſhop of one particular Church by his aſſignement to Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem. As though alſo the Doctor did not, at unawares, juſtify his refuters aſſumption; in graunting that Iames before his aſſignme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the particular charge of Ieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, was an Apoſtle abſolutely.

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:14068:254"/> if he had as ſoundly confirmed, as he did confidently vndertake, <hi>actum eſſet de certamine;</hi> the controverſy had ſoone bin ended. But how ſhould this be made apparant by S. Pauls epiſtles, when he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth nor can produce from thence any one word that ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that way? Yea it repenteth him (as it ſeemeth) that he had ſaid, <hi>It is apparant by his epiſtles;</hi> for in his defence, to prove that Timothy and Titus were by S. Paul ordeyned Biſhops of Epheſus &amp; Creet, he maketh this his firſt reaſon; (pag. 74.) becauſe in his epiſtles written to them, <hi>it is preſuppoſed that they were by him ordeyned Biſhops of thoſe Churches;</hi> and the Antecedent he proveth (pag. 75.) by this argument, becauſe <hi>it is preſuppoſed in the epiſtles, that the Apostle had committed to them epiſcopall authority, both in reſpect of ordination and juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, to be exerciſed in thoſe Churches.</hi> Whereas if he had ſtuck cloſe to the wordes of his ſermon; in diſſolving (as now he will needes) his firſt ſentence into a two fold reaſon; he ſhould have argued thus;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It is preſuppoſed in the epiſtles to Timothy and Titus that the Apoſtle had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted epiſcopall authoritie to them both in respect of ordination and juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction &amp;c. Ergo, it is apparant by thoſe epiſtles, that he had ordeyned them Biſhops.</hi> But (though he ſawe it) he was aſhamed to be ſeene to <note place="margin">The Doct. reaſoneth looſely; changeth his termes and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes: and then taxeth his Refuter for not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> argue thus looſely, and as we have often done, ſo againe muſt wee give him leave, to change at his pleaſure not onely his termes or phraſes, but alſo his very arguments.

Nay, who would not have judged (as the Refuter did) that the later clauſe, had bene a confirmation of the former?

And to his proofe thereof (viz. becauſe it is preſuppoſed in thoſe epiſtles, that the Apoſtle had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to them epiſcopall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:14068:254"/> both in reſpect of ordination &amp; juriſdiction to be exerciſed in thoſe Churches:) I anſwer, that he mingleth (and that deceipt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully) truth and falſhood togither.

Onely, whereas you aske the Refuter, how he could be ſo ignorant, or without judgment, as to think that Doct. whitgift in ſpeaking of the office and duty of a Biſhop conteyned in thoſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles, did meane onely that deſcription of a Biſhop which is ſet downe. 1.

The epiſtles written to Timothy doe give him directions for the diſcharge of his epiſcopal function, Ergo they doe declare, that he was a Biſhop: for this were to make him guilty of your owne fault, in begging of the queſtion <note place="margin">The Doct. beggeth the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> as you doe, when you add to your aſſumption or Antecedent, that ſuppoſition before examined; for if that be (as you ſay it is) the playne meaning of the aſſumption; then your ſecond argument

Paul) he now tendreth us a ſecond proſyllogiſme, to confirme the antecedent of his firſt argument. But to let him goe free with this fault, I will anſwer this argument as it ſtandeth; &amp; firſt to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition which (although it never ſawe the Sun before his defence came abroad) he taketh for graunted: becauſe <hi>T: C: and his Refuter have aſſailed it in vaine.</hi> So he flattereth himſelf in his owne conceite, but all in vaine. For a meaner Scholler then T. C. or his Refuter eyther, may eaſily diſcerne the inconſequence of his propoſition; although he may ſeme to have fortified the preſuppoſall which he concludeth, with a double bulwark, both of deſcribing the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and of preſcribing the duty of Biſhops. For S. Paul in his ſpeach to the Elders of Epheſus, Acts. 20. 18. &amp;c. deſcribing his owne office and authority as he was the Superintendent of that church &amp; preſident of the presbyterie there, plainely deſcribeth the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:14068:256"/> office and authority of all Superintendents or preſidents in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular churches; &amp; conſequently preſcribeth the duty which was to be performed, by all ſuch as ſhould ſucceed in the like office, till the comming of Chriſt. Notwithſtanding it were abſurd fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hence to inferre, that the Apoſtles ſpeach there, preſuppoſeth his ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the office of a ſuperintendent or Preſident of the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in that Church of Epheſus: wherefore neyther doth it follow, that the Apoſtle in his epiſtles to Tim: &amp; Titus preſuppoſeth their ordination to the office of Biſhops in the churches of Epheſus and Creete, though it ſhould be graunted, that in deſcribing their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as they were governours of thoſe churches; and in preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing their duty (ſuch as was to performed by them and their ſucceſſors till Chriſts comming) he both deſcribed the office, and preſcribed the duty of Biſhops.

                     <p>Behold here (good Reader) how the Doctor after many wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in and out is retired back to that which he aſſumed (as you may ſee ſect. 1.) for the proofe of his firſt argument. viz. that epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall authoritie ſtandeth in the power of ordination and juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: This was then taken for graunted, and ſo inforced to prove that Timothy &amp; Titus their ordination to the function of Biſhops, was preſuppoſed by S.

                     <p>For his adding the authority of Gregorie Nazianzen, Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, <note place="margin">Sect. 5. ad ſect 4. pag 78. 79.</note> Oecumenius, and Gregorie, who teſtify (as he ſaith) that the epiſles teach Biſhops how to behave themſelves in the church of God; is a ſecret confeſſion that he knoweth not how to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude from Saint Pauls owne words, that which he vndertooke to make apparant by his epiſtles to Timothy &amp; Titus.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe the Doctor will needs fitt to this laſt aſſumption &amp; the proofe thereof, that anſwere which was given to another; I wil firſt reduce it to the parts of his reaſoning; &amp; then peruſe the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which he bendeth againſt it. Whereas therefore he ſaith, that epiſcopall authoritie, cheefly conſiſteth in thoſe particulars (of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination &amp; juriſdiction) which Timothy and Titus had in charge; if by epiſcopall authoritie he meane that; which Biſhops haue now gotten into their hands, and appropriated to themſelves, then the propoſition is falſe; and the falſehood thereof made plaine by that ſuppoſed caſe (of a Democracie in time changed into an Ariſtocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and afterward into a Monarchie) layd downe by the Doctor in his Refuters wordes. pag. 79. but if he underſtand by epiſcopall authoritie, that which in the Apoſtles times, and with their allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, was ſeated in the function of dioceſan Biſhops; then the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption and the proofe thereof is contradicted by the Refuter; when he ſaith, that the directions given to Timothy and Titus (for ordination and juriſdiction) apperteyned not to dioceſan Biſhops; (for the Apoſtle dreamed of no ſuch ſovereigntie) but in particular unto Timothy and Titus by an higher power, as Evangeliſts: &amp; in generall to all the presbyters, as having the charge of thoſe affaires in their ſeverall congregations in the Churches right to adminiſter them. To impugn this anſwer, firſt he laboureth by two argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, to prove that Timothy and Titus did not perform thoſe things by an higher power. viz. 1. becauſe, they <hi>were to be done by a power which
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:14068:257"/> was to continue in the Church untill the end.</hi> 2. becauſe <hi>the power whereby Biſhops doe the things that Timothy and Titus had in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion, is ſo much of the Apoſtolicall power, as was to continue to the end.</hi> But if the Doctor had obſerved his Refuters meaning, (who by an higher power, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth that power of office, which was inveſted in the perſons of Timothy &amp; Titus for being Evangeliſts, he might perhaps have perceived the deceit, that lieth in his own reaſoning. For although the power of ordeyning and cenſuring conſidered ſimply (and in generall as the Refuter ſpeaketh) be ſuch as was to continue in the presbyters, though now by Biſhops appropriated to themſelves as he alſo granteth:) yet this hindreth not, but that (as the Apoſtles, ſo) Timothy &amp; Titus being Evangeliſts, did performe thoſe works by an higher power, that is, a power ſeated in an higher office. But if his meaning be, that Timothy and Titus did thoſe things by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of an office that was to continue; and that the power of doing thoſe works is derived to Biſhops by apoſtolicall allowance; what elſe doth he, but continue his old trade of begging? 2. In like manner he deceiveth himſelfe and his Reader, when he faſtneth a contradiction on his Refuter in ſaying, <hi>the Apoſtles dreamed not of any ſuch ſovereigntie, as now is in Biſhops, above Preſbyters;</hi> when he had before ſayd, <hi>that Timothy and Titus did the ſame things by an higher power</hi> (to wit of their Evangeliſticall function) which Biſhops have now appropriated to themſelves. 3. And he argueth too looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when to prove a falſhood in the refuters aſſertion (viz. that thoſe inſtructions were given to Timothy and Titus as Evangeliſts) he ſayth, <hi>they were given them as they were particularly aſſigned governours of the Churches of Epheſus and Creete.</hi> For it was not repugnant (but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry agreable) to the office of Evangeliſts to be aſſigned vnto the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of particular Churches at the pleaſure of the Apoſtles, on whom they attended. 4. In deed, if the Doctor could give us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one ſentence in thoſe epiſtles to Timothy &amp; Titus, ſhewing the charge of thoſe affaires to belong properly to Dioceſan Biſhops; I would freely confeſſe the Refuter had erred in denying it; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming the charge thereof to belong in generall unto the presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; but though wee haue wayted all this while, for the demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this point fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Apoſtles writings: yet we heare no newes of any argument, that clearely deduceth this concluſion from any word or phraſe, which Paul uſeth in his epiſtles; onely he ſayth, <hi>he hath ſufficiently proved this point before,</hi> lib. 3. Wherefore that the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:14068:258"/> may ſee how worthily he diſputeth there in defenſe of his Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſan Lords; I will pray leave to lay downe in open viewe, what he here referreth us unto.</p>
                     <p>In his third book cap. 3. ſect. 1. he giveth a threefold ſuperio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity <note place="margin">Section 6.</note> unto Biſhops over other Miniſters (viz. ſingularitie of prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence during life, power of ordination and power of juriſdiction) all which he groundeth upon Tit. 1. 5. And becauſe his Refuter had denied Titus to be a Biſhop; he referreth his Reader there, for the proofe thereof to that which was to followe, lib. 4. cap. 4. which we haue now to examine. In the meane time he deſireth him to take it for granted. In like manner towards the end of that book (cap. 5. ſect. 18.) he argueth that Biſhops had corrective power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the presbyters becauſe Timothy and Titus had ſuch power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the presbyters of Epheſus and Creete, as he proveth (if we may beleeve him) by moſt evident teſtimonyes out of Pauls epiſtles Tit. 1. 5. 1. Tim. 1. 3. &amp; 4. 19-22. And unto his Refuters anſwere (viz. that Tim. and Titus were not Biſhops and that he ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver prove they were), he returneth this reply. I deſire the Reader to <hi>ſuspend his iudgement,</hi> till he come to the proofes on <hi>both ſides, &amp; if he ſhall not find my proffes</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>for their being Biſhops better then his to the contrary, let him beleeve me in nothing.</hi> Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> here his wordes, and how confidently he relieth aforehand upon his proofes, which he meant to produce, for this aſſertion, <hi>that Timothy and Titus were Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops.</hi> Notwithſtanding when he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to make this apparant, &amp; that by the ſcriptures (yea by S. Pauls epiſtles written unto them) the maine iſſue of his whole reaſoning, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth at laſt to this effect.</p>
                     <p>Epiſcopall authoritie conſiſteth chiefly, in the power of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and juriſdiction.</p>
                     <p>But the authoritie which Timothy and Titus had in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Epheſus and Creet principally conſiſted in the power of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination and juriſdiction.</p>
                     <p>Ergo, their authoritie was epiſcopall; And conſequently they were Biſhops.</p>
                     <p>Here now if the propoſition be doubted of or denied, wee are ſent back to this former diſputation; where he begged that this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:14068:258"/> proceed to that example or ſuppoſall before mencioned; the rather for that he moſt proudly inſulteth over his Refuter as if he were a Browniſt or Anabaptiſt or had broached ſundry ſchiſmaticall no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties; as I am not aſhamed once againe to lay downe his wordes to the readers viewe; ſo I doubt not but to cleare him from thoſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Doctor asketh if it be not a <hi>phrenſy to urge the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſupremacie in Church government? and whether there be any ſhewe in ſcripture, or in reaſon that the ſheep ſhould rule their ſhepheard, or the flock their Pastor?</hi> Say as much ſhould be graunted as his queſtions im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply; muſt he not firſt prove that his Refuter giveth ſupremacie of rule unto the ſheep or people over their Paſtor before he can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude him to be ledde, by a fanaticall ſpirit againſt ſcripture &amp; rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? But is there not want of judgement rather in the Doctor, that imagineth the Paſtor to be ruled, by the ſheep or people; when the Church, (which is the whole body) hath the managing of all Church-affaires, by her Presbyters, which are the principall mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers? Doth not Cyprian that holy Martyr, ſay (lib. 1. epiſt. 4.) <hi>plebs ipſa maxim</hi>è <hi>habet poteſtatem, vel eligendi dignos ſacerdotes vel indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos recuſandi, quod et ipſum videmus de divina authoritate deſcendere?</hi> And how oft doth Auſtin ſay, <hi>that Peter ſignified the Church, and bare the perſon of the Church; when Chriſt ſayd unto him, Tibi dabo claves &amp;c.</hi> Mat. 16.

Peter the Apoſtle, &amp; chief of the Apoſtles is conſtreyned to give an account to the Church; neyther doth he diſdeyne it becauſe he knew himſelfe to be, not a Lord but a Miniſter of the Church. The Church is the ſpouſe of Chriſt, and Lady of the houſe; Peter a ſervant and Miniſter. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the Church may not onely exact an account of her Miniſters;
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:14068:260"/> but alſo reject and depoſe them; if they be not fit. And in giving this preheminence to the Church above Peter, doth he ſpeak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſcripture or againſt reaſon? Doth not S. Paul acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the ſame, touching himſelfe and his fellow Apoſtles? 1. Cor. 3. 21. 22. 2. Cor. 4. 5. Is it not then an abſurd fancie (if not frenzie) to urge as the Doctor doth, lib. 3. paſſim) the ſuperio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of one Biſhop in an whole Dioceſe or Province, above all the Presbyters and people thereof? Notwithſtanding as the Refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter doth no where ſay, ſo neither can it be gathered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his words, that the form of Church-governme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t was at the firſt, or now ought to be wholly democraticall or popular; the Doctor is not ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t (as appeareth l. 3. p. 2. &amp; 3.) that his Ref: pleadeth for the Ariſtocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall forme of government, as that which in his opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought to be eſtabliſhed in the ſeverall Churches. Neyther doth he therein croſſe himſelfe, or any of his fellowes that favour the pariſh diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, for they all (as I am perſwaded) doe hold the eccleſiaſticall government to be a mixt forme compounded of all three ſtates, as many worthy divines doe confidently mainteyne.

For as in reſpect of Chriſt, who is the head, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the whole Church in generall, but alſo of every particular vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church (Epheſ. 4. 15. 1. Cor. 12. 27) the Church may be truely reputed a Kingdome or Monarchy: ſo it hath ſome reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance unto a Monarchy, in regard of that preheminence which the Paſtor hath above other Church-officers. But becauſe no one Paſtor or Biſhop, hath power to governe, or determine cauſes ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical pro ſuo arbitratu after his pleaſure, but <hi>ex conſilio compres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterorum,</hi> by the Counſell of his fellow-Elders: the regiment of the Church more properly reſembleth an <hi>Ariſtocracy.</hi> And in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the peoples conſent is not to be neglected, in cauſes of greateſt moment, it agreeth in part with a <hi>Democracie:</hi> notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a meere <hi>Democracie,</hi> wherein all matters are handled of all (ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quato jure) by an equall right, we doe no leſſe deteſt, then that u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurped Monarchie of Lordly Prelates, which other reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches have aboliſhed.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore the Doctor dreameth of a dry ſommer in a dripping <note place="margin">Section 8.</note> yeare, when he ſuppoſeth in his third <hi>fancie,</hi> that we hold the lawes of Church-government preſcribed in the epiſtles to Tim. &amp; Titus,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:14068:260"/> to have bin provided for ſuch a popular ſtate, wherein the people doe rule their leaders. They were provided for a mixt ſtate, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in many presbyters vnder the guidance of one Paſtor or preſident, doe adminiſter &amp; execute all matters, with the peoples conſent &amp; approbation. And in the affirmation as we have the aſſent of the moſt and the beſt divines of later times (Calvin on Titus. 1. 5. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za on Tim. Cap. 5. 19. 22. and Tit. 3. 10. and ſundry others) ſo we have the Apoſtles owne warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in the cloſe of his epiſtles, with theſe words, <hi>grace be with you, or with you all.</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 22. Tit. 3. 15. for by this it appeareth, that what was written ſpecially by name to Timothy and Titus, was intended to be of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon uſe, not onely for other Miniſters; but alſo in ſome ſort to all the Saints, that then converſed in thoſe places. Moreover ſince the Apoſtle char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth Titus to obſerve in the ordination of Elders that order which he had before enjoyned him (Tit. 1. 5.) whence can we better derive that order, then from his owne practiſe, and his fellow-A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles who uſed aswell in ordination, as in other Church-affaires, both the advice and help of other Miniſters; and the approbation of the people; as appeareth by theſe ſcriptures. Acts. 1. 15. 23. 26. and 6. 2. 3. and 14. 23. and 15. 6. 22. 23. 1. Cor. 5. 3. 4. &amp; 2. Cor. 2. 10. The Doctor therefore is miſledd by his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, when he imagineth that the Apoſtles wordes unto Timothy and Titus, <hi>(Lay not handes raſhly &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>doe thou avoid an Haeretick)</hi> did ſo cloſe up all power of ordination and juriſdiction in their handes, that neyther people nor presbyters, had or might have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtroak at all in thoſe matters. As for his gibing objection. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the whole Iſland of Creete was a pariſh too;</hi> it deſerveth no other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer then this; when he juſtifyeth his collection, from any words in his refuters anſwer; I will acknowledge him for an honeſt man: mean while let the reader take notice of this, that the Doctor (in a fewe leaves after pag. 88) noteth this ſpeach of his refuter, <hi>that Creet had many Churches;</hi> which argueth neceſſarily; that the whole Iland could not be one onely pariſh.</p>
                     <p>The laſt fancy falſly fained by the Doctor is this, <hi>that the popular</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Sect. 9.</note> 
                        <hi>ſtate of the ſeverall Churches, did firſt degenerate into an Ariſtocracie, and after into a Monarchie;</hi> he ſhould haue ſayd, that the well tempered Democracie, did degenerate firſt into a ſimple Ariſtocracie, &amp; after into an abſolute Monarchy. But he endeavoreth to ſhewe that the ſeverall Churches were at the firſt governed Monarchically, to wit,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:14068:261"/> by the Apoſtles, or Apoſtolicall men ſeverally. For Apoſtles he nameth Iames that ruled perpetually; and Peter and Paul &amp;c. for a time. And of Apoſtolicall men that were perpetuall governors he hath good ſtore, as Mark, Timothy, Titus, Evodius, Simo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſonne of Cleophas &amp;c. But where are his proofes that all theſe or any of them, governed Monarchically; and by their ſole authority. Concerning Iames it is already ſhewed, that his government was farre ſhort of that ſole authoritie, which our Biſhops carry at this day, in the managing of Church-cauſes. And by that which hath bene now ſayd concerning Timothy &amp; Titus, the ſame may be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed of their government in the Churches of Epheſus &amp; Creet. But he asketh whether Paul did not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitt the ordination of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters unto Titus, without mentioning eyther of Presbyterie or people? And we may ask him, what mention he findeth there, of prayers, or hands-impoſition, which ought to concurre with or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination? if he can include them (as being vnderſtood) in the word <hi>kataſteſes</hi> Tit. 1. 5; wee have as good reaſon to include the aſſiſtance of other presbyters, and the peoples approbation in the words fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, <hi>hoos egoo ſoi dietaxamen as I have appointed thee: Quis enim cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat Paulum &amp;c. who may beleeve Paul otherwiſe to have ordered Titus then he and the reſt of the Apostles themſelves had in vſe?</hi> Muſcul. loc. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. de elect. Miniſt. Againe, he asketh or rather argueth in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. <hi>Are not all his precepts for ordination and Church-government dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted onely to Titus for Creete, and to Timothy for Epheſus?</hi> and doth not this evidently ſhewe, <hi>that (howſoever they might uſe eyther the preſence or conſent of the people, or the counſell &amp; adviſe of the preſbyters in cauſes of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt moment, as Princes alſo doe in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-wealths, yet) the ſway of eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall government was in them?</hi> If there be any evidence or ſtrength of truth in this reaſon, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the like muſt be acknowledged in this that followeth; Our Saviour Chriſt directeth in ſingular termes vnto Peter onely both his whol ſpeach concerning the keies of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and the power thereof; Math. 16. and that precept of feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſheep and lambes, and of confirming his brethren. Ioh. 21. 15. 17. Luk. 22. 32. Wherefore however Peter might uſe the help <note place="margin">The Doct. reaſoneth well for Rome.</note> and aſſiſtance of his fellow-Apoſtles in all thoſe workes; and the preſence or conſent of the people, in the adminiſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the keies; yet the cheef power and ſway of all was in him alone. Good newes for Rome, if the Doctor will give allowance to his argument; but the truth is, ſuch ſingular ſpeaches directed to one onely, doe not
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:14068:261"/> argue in that one any ſuch preheminent power, as the Romaniſts and Prelatiſts doe from thence gather. So that ſince the Doct. can not prove that Timothy and Titus, had any ſuch ſingular and ſole power in Church-government, as the Doctor judgeth to be due unto Biſhops; it is plaine that he buildeth upon a vayne and falſe preſuppoſall, when he ſaith, it is preſuppoſed in the epiſtles to Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy and Titus, that they had epiſcopall authoritie; and that the directions given to them were precedents for dioceſan Biſhops, in the exerciſe of their function.</p>
                     <p>But for the proofe of this, he hath another argument in ſtore, thus framed,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thoſe things which were written to informe not Timothy and Titus alone,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Sect. 10. ad ſect. 7. pag 83.</note> 
                        <hi>as extraordinary perſons, but them and their ſucceſſors to the worlds end; were written to informe dioceſan Biſhops.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But thoſe epiſtles were written to informe not Timothy and Titus alone as extraordinary perſons; but them and their ſucceſſors to the worlds end.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Therefore they were written to informe dioceſan Biſhops.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Vnto the Aſſumption the Refuter anſwereth by diſtinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thus; that it is true if vnderſtood of ſucceſſors in authority or power of performing the ſame works, but falſe, if meant of ſucceſſion in the ſame office. The Doct. therefore firſt indeavoureth to prove what his Refuter denyeth and yet in the winding up of all, would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade his reader, that what the Refuter granted is ſufficient for the truth of his aſſumption. But he is to be advertized, that vnleſſe he make good what his Refuter denyeth, he cannot conclude what he vndertaketh. For whether we look to his former aſſertion, which he ſaith is here againe proved, himſelfe doth thus explaine it. (ſect. 3. in the beginning) that in the epiſtles to Tim. and Titus, S. Paul intended to informe them as Dioceſan Biſhops, and in them all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Dioceſans: or whether wee look to the neareſt ſcoape of his wordes in his ſermon (pag. 74.) it is evident, he there intendeth, to prove that which he ſuppoſed would be anſwered to his former objection (viz. that the things ſpoken to Timothy and Titus, were ſpoken to them as extraordinarie perſons, whoſe authority (he ſhould have ſayd office) ſhould die with them) which cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved vnleſſe he prove that they were ſpoken to them as perſons bearing an ordinarie function; wherein their ſucceſſors ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the ſame authoritie to the worlds end. Neyther is this to deny his concluſion, as he falſely affirmeth; but to contradict his aſſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:14068:262"/> in that ſenſe, which is neceſſarie to make it good; becauſe otherwiſe he argueth not ad idem. Let us therefore ſee how well his proofes are fitted to the aſſumption. <hi>I prove it,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>first by testimonie both of Paul and of Ambroſe; and after by reaſon.</hi> And firſt by S. Pauls teſtimonie, that <hi>he ſtreitely chargeth Timothy that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements and directions which he gave him, ſhould be kept inviolable, vntill the appearing of our Lord Ieſus. 1. Tim. 6. 14. Ergo, they were to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by ſuch as ſhould have the like authority</hi> (and the ſame office) <hi>to the end.</hi> The conſequence of this Enthymeme dependeth upon this propoſition. That the commaundements and directions given in charge unto Timothy, could not be kept inviolable unto the end, without a ſucceſſion of ſuch as ſhould have not only the like autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, but alſo the ſame office untill the end of the world. The which is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>latly denyed, and cannot be fortifyed by that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth (ſcz: that thoſe commandements could not be performed in the perſon of Timothy who was not to continue to the end) ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of his diſiunction are inſufficient, when he taketh it for graunted, <hi>that thoſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundements must be performed eyther in Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothees own perſon, or in ſuch as ſucceeded him in the ſame function:</hi> for the Doctor cannot be ignorant, that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement which Chriſt gave to his Apoſtles (Math. 28. 19, 20.) for preaching and bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, was to be kept inviolable unto the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of Chriſt: ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could it be peformed by the Apoſtles alway in their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, or by ſuch as ſucceeded them in the Apoſtolike function. It is performed (as all the world knoweth) by ſucceſſors in a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent functio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which haue authoritie to doe the ſame works; though neither in the ſame office, nor yet with that ample co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion for the extent of their juriſdiction. In like manner the Refuter ſaith, that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundements given to Timothy and Titus for ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and juriſdiction, were continued in the Church by presbyters, which ſucceeded them (though in a differing office) according to that ordinary courſe, which God had appointed for his Church.</p>
                     <p>Thus much for S. Paul, whom the Doctor now leaveth and cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth help of Mr. Calvin, T. C. and others to conclude his purpoſe: <note place="margin">Sect. 11. ad ſect. 7. pag 83. 84.</note> ſcz. that the commandements given to Timothy, were to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by ſuch as ſucceeded him in the ſame office. <hi>Mr Calvin,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>vnderſtandeth in the name of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, thoſe things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he had hitherto diſcourſed concerning the office of Timothy.</hi> And doe not we alſo underſtand the things or works given in charge, under the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:14068:262"/> name of the commandement? Neyther deny we that thoſe things belonged to the office or miniſtery of Timothy. Yet we refuſe that ſucceſſion in the ſame miniſteriall function, which the Doct. would wring (if he could tell how) out of Pauls charge to performe the things ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded untill Chriſts ſecond co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming. 2. True it is, that T. C. and others finding among other precepts in Pauls epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to Timothy this, <hi>that the governing Elders are to be honoured as well as the Teachers,</hi> doe from thence conclude the continuance of both functions; and why ſhould they not, ſince the continuance of Biſhops and Deacons is of all interpreters rightly gathered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the rules that are layd down concerning their functions. 1. Tim. 3. the former being no leſs ordinary, and perpetually neceſſary, then the later. Yet the continuance of Timothy his office cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded vpon the ſame ground, till it may appeare that his function was alſo perpetuall and not extraordinary. 3. As for the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Ambroſe, it nothing helpeth the Doctor, except it be to ſhewe, how groſly he plaieth the Sophiſter in thus arguing. S. Paul in his words. 1. Tim. 6. 14. hath regard unto Timothees ſucceſſors, that they after his example might continue the wel ordering of the Church. So ſaith S. Ambroſe. Ergo, in his underſtanding (ſaith the Doct.) he meant ſuch as ſucceeded Timothy in the ſame office. As though the Fathers did confound the offices of Apoſtles &amp; E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts with thoſe Paſtors &amp; Biſhops, which ſucceeded them in the rule and government of the Churches, becauſe they ſay the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter were ſucceſſors to the former.</p>
                     <p>4. His reaſon followeth now to be examined. <hi>Whatſoever autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is perpetually neceſſary; and ſuch as without which, the Church neyther can be governed, nor yet continued: the ſame is not peculier to extraordinary perſons, or to die with them: but by an ordinary derivation to be continued in their ſucceſſors. But the authority committed to Timothy and Titus, was perpetually neceſſary and ſuch as without which, the Church neyther can be governed; (as without juriſdiction), nor continued (as without ordination.) Therefore the authority committed to them, was not peculiar to them as extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary perſons, but by an ordinary derivation to be continued in thoſe that ſucceeded them.</hi> Wherevnto I anſwer as before; if he ſpeak of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at large in authority onely; he wandreth from the queſtion: If of ſucceſſion in the ſame office; I diſclaime the later braunch of the propoſition; for all men knowe by the perpetuity of Paſtorall authority, by which the word and ſacraments are ſtill continued
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:14068:263"/> in the Church (whereas the diſpenſation of theſe holy things was firſt committed by Chriſt to the Apoſtles Math. 28. 19. 20.) that the perpetuall neceſſity of an authority to performe this or that miniſteriall work, doth not neceſſarily require any to ſucceed in the ſame function that firſt enjoyed that authority. And this is ſo evident a truth, that rather then the Doctor will contradict it, he will become non-ſuite in this point; and perſwade his Reader, if he can, that ſucceſſion in authority onely (which was never denyed) is ſufficient for his purpoſe, the contrary whereof is before ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently made manifeſt.</p>
                     <p>To follow him therfore in the defence of his propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaith, <note place="margin">Sect. 12. ad ſect. 8. pag 85.</note> it is <hi>grounded on this hypotheſis; that dioceſan Biſhops were the ſucceſſors of Timothy and Titus;</hi> and therefore reaſoneth thus,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If the ſucceſſors of Timothy and Titus were dioceſan Biſhops; then thoſe things which were written to informe their ſucceſſors; were written to informe dioceſan Biſhops.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But the ſucceſſors of Timothy &amp; Titus, were dioceſan Biſhops.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Therefore thoſe things that were written to informe their ſucceſſors, were written to informe dioceſan Biſhops.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here the Doctor is againe to be advertiſed, that the true hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis of the former propoſition is this; that dioceſan Biſhops not onely de facto were; but alſo de jure ought to have been ſucceſſors vnto Timothy &amp; Titus, in the exerciſe of their authority; &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the conſequence of the later propoſition, which mencioneth their ſucceſſion de facto onely, is too weake; for vnleſs it were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine that S. Paul intended that dioceſan Biſhops ſhould ſucceede them; his writing of purpoſe to direct their ſucceſſors; cannot argue that he meant by them to informe dioceſan Biſhops. It had bin fit therefore, the Doctor had ſhewed from ſome wordes of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle in theſe epiſtles, or from ſome other Scriptures, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle aymed at the ſucceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſuch Biſhops; but this was too hard a task for him; and therefore he perſwadeth his reader, that their ſucceſſion de jure cannot be denied, if their ſucceſſion de facto be proved. Which he indeavoreth by two arguments.</p>
                     <p>Firſt by this diſiunction. <hi>Either dioceſan Biſhops were their ſucceſsors, or the preſbyteries, or the whole congregation. But neyther the preſbyteries, nor the whole congregation Ergo dioceſan Biſhops.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for the laſt member of this diſiunction, it is abſurdly added by the Doctor, howſoever he would ſeem to haue done it to pleaſe
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:14068:263"/> his Ref: for although he ſay that the right was in the church; yet he giveth the execution to the presbytery of each congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: neyther yet is he ſo to be vnderſtood, as if he denied a preheminence for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſake, vnto ſome one to be the mouth of the reſt, in executing that which was by the whole presbytery decreed. Which prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence as it did by right belonge to Timothy &amp; Titus in regarde of their Evangeliſticall function during their ſtay in thoſe places; ſo it was devolved after their departure to him that was primus presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or <hi>proestoos</hi> preſident of the preſbyters; that is to ſay, in each congregation, to the Paſtor; and in a Synode or aſſembly of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors and presbyters of many Churches to that one which with the conſent, &amp; choyſe of his brethren moderated the action. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſpeak of ſucceſſors vnto Timothy &amp; Titus, in that ſpeciall preſidencie, which they held at Epheſus and in Creete; his diſiun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is to be diſclaimed as inſufficient; becauſe it wanteth the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch a preſident as we give to each presbyterie and Synode. His ſecond argument, followeth in this forme;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thoſe who ſucceeded Timothy and Titus in the government of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Epheſus and Creet, were their ſucceſſors: But the Biſhops of Epheſus and Creet did ſucceed Timothy &amp; Titus in the government of thoſe Churches. Therefore they (viz. Dioceſan Biſhops) were their ſucceſſors.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Well may you ſee, the Doct. would faine be thought to be rich, <note place="margin">The Doct. is poore &amp; proveth idem pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For is this argument any better then a beggerly proving of the point denyed by the ſelf ſame? is it not all one to ſucceed them in the government of thoſe Churches; and to be their ſucceſſors in the like authoritie? Perhaps he meaneth now to conclude (though before he ſayd it was needleſſe) that Dioceſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Biſhops were their ſucceſſors in office: if ſo, then hath he ſomewhat more to doe then he expecteth, he muſt prove his propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which he beggeth. Meane while (till his meaning herein be knowne) I flatly deny his aſſumption, and am ready once againe to liſten to his proofes of this propoſition, <hi>that dioceſan Biſhops ſucceeded Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and Titus in the like power of government over the Churches of Epheſus &amp; Creete.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, touching Timothies ſucceſſors in Epheſus, whereas he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadgeth, <note place="margin">Sect. 13. ad pag. 86. &amp; 87.</note> that the Angel of the Church of Epheſus, Apoc. 2. 1. was one of Timothies next ſucceſſours, he was anſwered, that he doth but tediouſly begge the queſtion in aſſuming that the ſame Angell was a Dioceſan Biſhop; and now overpaſſing this point, (as <note place="margin">The D. beggeth.</note>
                        <pb n="114" facs="tcp:14068:264"/> if he ſawe it not) he appealeth to his Refuters conſcience, <hi>whether that Angel was not the Biſhop or governour of the Church of Epheſus, and ſucceeded Timothy in the government &amp;c.</hi> Wherein if he ſhould gratifye him, with the graunt of as much as he deſireth, ſcz. that the Angel was one ſingular perſon &amp; a Biſhop, yea and a ſucceſſour unto Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy and one of thoſe 27 Biſhops mentioned by Leontius in the Councell of Calcedon; yet (the Doctor isnever the neer) it will not follow that he was a dioceſan Biſhop; for that other braunch of the Refuters anſwer unto Leontius teſtimony ſtandeth yet unremoved, viz. <hi>that howſoever the later of theſe 27 Biſhops might be Dioceſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s; yet the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer were not.</hi> The Doctor ſayth, <hi>It is certayne that both the later and the former were not onely Dioceſan, but alſo Metropolitan Biſhops;</hi> but I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, he is much deceived, if he think we will take his bare affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>It is certeine,</hi> for a ſufficient confirmation of the matter in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. And if Timothies i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mediate ſucceſſours were (for certeinty) Metropolitan Biſhops, why is the Doctor ſo fearfull, as he ſeemeth to be (lib. 2. pag. 114. &amp; lib. 4. pag. 131.) to aſcribe their originall alſo to the Apoſtles inſtitution? And why doth he by conſequence contradict it, in ſaying, <hi>It is evident and cannot be denyed, but that there were dioceſan Biſhops, ſuch as ours, before there were any Metropolitans?</hi> lib. 3. pag. 20. &amp; lib. 4. pag. 7. for me thinks he ſhould bluſh to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that Timothy and Titus were bare Dioceſans, if their i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate ſucceſſors were Metropolitans.</p>
                     <p>As touching Creet, and ſucceſſion to Titus in the government thereof, the Doctor confeſſeth, that he hath not any where read of his next ſucceſſor. The firſt that he findeth to haue that ample go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, was <hi>Philip</hi> mencioned by Dionyſius of Corinth, apud Euſeb. lib. 4. Cap. 21. &amp; 23. Yet betweene him and Titus, there is an apparant difference; for Philip had the ſpeciall charge of the Church of <hi>Gortyna;</hi> whereas Titus was equally truſted by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, with the overſight of all the Churches in the whole Iland. He addeth, <hi>though there were no direct proofe that Dioceſan or Provincial Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, were the ſucceſsors of Timothy and Titus, yet it might eaſily be gathered by other Churches from whoſe forme of government, Epheſus and Creet vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not.</hi> After having ſayd, that <hi>Mark</hi> at <hi>Alexandria, Evodius</hi> at <hi>Antioche,</hi> &amp; <hi>Linus</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> had the ſame authoritie that Timothy and Titus had, he argueth demonſtratively in this manner;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It may not be doubted but that each of theſe had Biſhops (he ſhould have ſayd, Dioceſan Biſhops) to their ſucceſſors in the Apostles times. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:14068:264"/> the Refuter ſhould not make it ſo ſtrange, that Dioceſan Biſhops were ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors of Timothy and Titus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whereto I anſwer. It ſeemeth then the Refuter is not to be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for eſteeming the later a ſtrange point, if the former may be doubted, and why ſhould he not make a doubt of it, ſeing the D. hath no better teſtimony, or reaſon to confirme it, then his owne naked affirmation, <hi>It cannot be denyed.</hi> Thus we have ſeene the Do. beſt defence: for that epiſcopall function, which he giveth to Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy &amp; Titus, his next labour is to remove the objections made againſt his aſſertion.</p>

But it is usuall with him, when he would ſeem to remove our objections, to fit them to his owne ſtrength, that his anſwer may ſeeme to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the victory with it. Otherwiſe ſince himſelfe aſſenteth (pag. 94) to this difference, between the function of Evangeliſts and Biſhops, that the former were not tied to any one place, as the later are; he might (and in upright dealing onght) to haue framed to himſelfe at the firſt this objection. viz. that Timothy and Titus were not ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or bound to attend during life, on the charge of thoſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in Epheſus &amp; Creet; and therefore they were not by Paul or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned Biſhops of thoſe Churches. But then his diſtinction <hi>of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall and ordinarie reſidence,</hi> would not have reached to impugne, eyther the antecedent or the conſequence of the argument. For the conſequence implyeth this propoſition, that, <hi>all whom the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ordeyned Biſhops of particular Churches, were affixed or bound to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall charge of thoſe Churches;</hi> This if the Doctor deny, it may eaſily
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:14068:265"/> be proved by the lawe of God and man, and by the teſtimony of the beſt writers in all ages; but I will ſpare this labour, ſeing the D himſelfe cannot impugne it (as I ſuppoſe) without contradiction to himſelfe. For how can Biſhops enjoy by the prerogative of their function, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> ſingularity of preheminence during life; if their aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the charge of the Church which they holde, bindeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not to attend on the feeding and overſight thereof, as long as they live? I graunt that Biſhops may upon ſpeciall and extraordinarie occaſion, not onely traveile to other places; but alſo be removed unto other Churches: but in their abſence they remaine bound to the charge of the Church firſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to them; till by a lawfull calling they be removed, to the ſetled overſight of an other church. Wherefore an ordinary reſidence in Epheſus and Creet, is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to prove that they were Biſhops of thoſe Churches; unleſſe it may alſo appeare that they were bound to the perpetuall charge thereof; and that the ſame band recalled them back, when thoſe extraordinarie matters were diſpatched, which called them away for a time. But this is more then he can prove, eyther by teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of ſcripture, or any other evidence. If he will conclude ſuch a band of continuance from the Apoſtles wordes: 1. Tim. 1. 3. and Tit. 1. 5. he muſt argue thus;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Paul requested Timothy</hi> proſmenein, <hi>to continue ſtill in Epheſus; and appointed Titus epidiorthoſei ta leiponta, to continue to redreſſe what was</hi>

                        <hi>wanting in Creete. Ergo they were bound to make their ordinary reſidence there (as having the proper charge of thoſe churches) during life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If there be any ſtrength in this conſequence, then there muſt be a truth in this propoſition, that men are bound to make their ordinarie reſidence, during life in thoſe places, where they are eyther requeſted <hi>proſmeinai,</hi> or left <hi>epidiorthoſai</hi> &amp;c.

Wherefore the Doctors collection (which from the Apoſtles words inferreth that Titus was not lefte there for a brunt (to ſet things in order) &amp; ſo to come away, but to continue redreſſing what ſhould be amiſſe, and ſtill to keep that Church in reparation) is a falſe gloſſe.

                     <p>
                        <hi>But Timothy and Titus were ſo imployed after they had been lefte in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus and in Creet. Therefore they were not made Biſhops by the Apoſtle of Epheſus &amp; Creet.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The propoſition; he deemed ſo plaine, that he thought none would be ſo bold or vnreaſonable as to deny it: for could not the Apoſtle foreſee, what uſe he was like to have further of them? or could he not find others, which were at liberty, whom he might ſend hither &amp; thither &amp;c.

For as he ſent for him to come to Rome (2. Tim. 4. 9. 21.) ſo he was there with him at the writing of his epiſtles to the Philippians &amp; Coloſſians and to Philemon as their inſcriptions (verſ. 1. of each epiſtle) doe ſhew<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And from thence he was ſent to the Philippians in Macedonia, as may well be conjectured by Pauls own words, Phil. 2. 19. 23. And to the Hebrewes he ſaith, (Cap. 13. 23.) know that our brother Timothy is delivered: with whom (if he come ſhortly) I wil ſee you: which argueth that he had been a priſoner; &amp; being elſwhere imployed was by the Apoſtle expected, that he might againe uſe him for a companion in his traveiles. It is apparant therefore, that (as the Refuter ſaith) the Apoſtle ſtill imployed him in his Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſticall function. And ſo he did Titus alſo ſeing he was called to meete him at Nicopolis. (Tit. 3. 12.) and afterwards being at Rome, was ſent from thence to Dalmatia. 2. Tim. 4. 10. which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth plainely (as is before obſerved) that they were not by Paul ordeyned Biſhops.</p>
                     <p>As for that diſcourſe which the Doctor runneth into (ſerm: pag. <note place="margin">Sect. 4. ad p. 99</note> 76. and. 77.) concerning the time when Timothy was left at E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus: it was overpaſſed by the Refuter as an idle digreſſion from the preſent controverſy, <hi>of his being affixed to the perpetuall charge of the Church of Epheſus.</hi> But ſince he urgeth it a freſh, and ſaith, <hi>that their opinion which think that Timothy was required to staye at Epheſus but for a ſhort time, when Paul went into Macedonia Acts 20. is contrary to S.

The like phraſe in other places importeth ſome good ſpace of ſtaye: as 1. Cor. 16. 7. Act. 15. 33. &amp; 18. 23. (ſee Aretius in Actes 15. 33. &amp; Calvin on 1.

(theſe very wordes I ſay) doe ſhew that he deferred his owne foreintended journey into Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia, for a time of purpoſe to ſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſome time in Aſia, in viſiting &amp; ſtrengthning the Churches. And the Apoſtles own words (1. Cor. 16. 5. 7. 8. 9.) doe plainly import, that he reſolved to returne vnto Epheſus, there to ſet forwardes the Lordes work; becauſe he ſawe both an effectuall doore opened vnto him, to doe much good; and a ſtrong oppoſition of many adverſaries, likely to doe hurt, if he ſhould have departed out of thoſe quarters what hindreth then, but that Timothy might diſpatch his journey and returne thither again in this time of the Apoſtles ſtay at Epheſus and in Aſia; which came betwene his ſending them, and that Tumult; that is recorded afterwards? Wherfore, if this cannot be with better reaſon impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned then yet I ſee; it will follow inevitablie, that Timothy his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boade at Epheſus was very ſhort; ſeing it is certeine he was with Paul in Grecia. Acts. 20. 2. 3. 4. when he reſolved to returne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence through Macedonia.</p>
                     <p>Now to anſwer the ſecond, that which he ſuppoſeth moſte cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine is altogither vntrue, viz. that Timothy (with the reſte that are named Acts. 20. 4.) accompanied S. Paul into Macedonia, till he came to Philippi, and there parted from him, to goe before vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Troas; The words of the Evangeliſt, are that Timothy &amp; others accompanied him <hi>(achrites aſias)</hi> vnto Aſia; that is, til he came to the Coaſts of Aſia; and that there they (parting from him) went before and tarried for him and Luke, (with others that continued with him) at Troas. Whereby it appeareth that they all took ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:14068:267"/> in Graecia, (the better to avoid the ambuſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of the Iewes) and ſo paſſing by the coaſts of Aſia (as they muſt to goe into the coaſts of Macedonia) there landed Timothy &amp; the reſt, who were to meet with Paul and his company at Troas, after he had diſpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched his affaires in Macedonia. Wherefore the Doctors miſconcei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the tenour of S. Lukes ſtorie, is a greater errour then their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that referre the time, both of Timothies ſtay at Epheſus (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned him 1. Tim. 1. 3.) to Pauls ſecond voiage towards Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia recorded Act. 20. 3. And of S. Pauls writing his firſt epiſtle to Timothy; vnto his being in Macedonia there mencioned verſ. 6. For what hindreth but that Timothy parting fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Paul in the coaſts of Aſia neer to Epheſus might then be requeſted to ſtay at Epheſus; and be ſaluted alſo with letters from Philippi, or ſome other citie in Macedonia? Surely if the Doctor had not been ſtrangely miſledd by his owne conceit, he would never have deemed this a ſtrange conceit in Mr Beza.</p>
                     <p>So then, it being apparant that the Doctor hath nothing of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny moment to object againſt Timothies ſtay at Epheſus, in one of <note place="margin">Sect. 5.</note> thoſe voyages, which Paul made into Macedonia; is it not much more ſafe to aſcribe it to one of theſe; then to dreame (as the D. doth) of a new voiage thither after his deliverance from his bonds at Rome? Specially, ſeing he hath no warrant, neyther from Gods word, nor from any ſound hiſtoriographer, to mainteyn his ſtrange conceit; but onely a falſe ſuppoſall, that it cannot fittly be aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to any of his journeys mencioned in the Actes. For how can he prove that which he ſo confidently avoucheth, touchiug Pauls deliverance from his bands at Rome, and renewing of his former traveiles for 9. yeres after? And when this is proved, how will he demonſtrate, eyther from Pauls epiſtles, or any other monume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of antiquitie (from whence himſelfe ſaith (ſerm. p. 78) the Actes of thoſe 9. yeares muſt be gathered) that Paul made a newe voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age into Macedonia, and in that traveile paſſing by Epheſus, lefte Timothy there? And if he could prove this; is he not ſingular in his conceit, that this was the time of placing Timothy in his Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick? For did not Paul himfelſe tell the Elders of Epheſus (whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he parted from them at Miletum. (Act. 20. 25.) that he knew that they all among who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had gone preaching the kingdom of God; ſhould ſee his face no more? And hath the Doctor forgotten that himſelfe teacheth us (ſerm. pag. 70. &amp; 88.) and pag. 63. of this
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:14068:268"/> defenſe) that the Apoſtles did ſubſtitute Biſhops in their roomes, when they were to diſcontinue, from the Churches, which they had planted; and that for the avoiding of factions in their abſence? No reaſon therefore he ſhould thinke that Paul would neglect to give them a Biſhop; at or before ſo ſolemne a departing from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; ſpecially ſeing (as he knewe he ſhould ſee their face no more, ſo) he foreſawe that after his departing, there ſhould greivous wolves en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in, and perverſe Teachers ſpring up from amongſt themſelves. Act. 20. 29. 30. To conclude therefore this queſtion, thus I argue;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If Timothy had any ordination at all to the Biſhopprick of Epheſus, the ſame must be at one of thoſe journeys, which he tooke into Macedonia, Actes</hi> 20. 1. 3.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But he had no ordination to his Biſhopprick at any of thoſe journeys.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Therefore he had none at all.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The conſequence of the propoſition is apparant by thinges laſt touched, viz. that at Pauls laſt parting from thoſe coaſtes, he knew he ſhould ſee them no more, and that no monumentes of Antiquity doe aſcribe this worke to any latter voiage. And in the firſt, whereof mencion is made Actes 16. 10. 12; Timothy was his companion, as appeareth verſ. 1. 3. &amp;c. neyther was the Church at Epheſus then planted, much leſs fit to receive and mainteine a Biſhop, as may be gathered from Actes 18. 19. 25. 26. &amp; 19. 1. 7. &amp;c. As for the aſſumption, though the Doctor acknowledgeth the truth of it; yet we relie not on his conceites, but on farre ſurer groundes. For it is alſo ſhewed, that he was not affixed, to the permanent charge of that Church; neyther did he long ſtay there; but followed the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles call, aſwell after as before. To all which I adde this one reaſon, more peculiarly fitting the time, mencioned in the aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If Timothy had not as yet received the epiſcopall charge of the Epheſian Church, when Paul took his leave of their Elders. Act. 20. 25. 28. then was he not ordeyned in any of his iourneyes into Macedonia, mencioned Act. 20. 1. 2. 3.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But the antecedent is true. Ergo, alſo the conſequent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The aſſumption, or Antecedent, I prove as followeth; <hi>At what time the Church of Epheſus enjoyed many Biſhops, to whome the charge of feeding and governing the whole flock did apperteine in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon, by speciall charge given them by</hi> St. <hi>Paul; and that without any intimation of any ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:14068:268"/> ſet over them, to whoſe direction they ſhould yeeld obedience: at that time, Timothy had not yet received ſuch an epiſcopall charge as giveth him a ſingularitie of preheminence above all other miniſters in that Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But at the time of Pauls taking his leave of the Elders of Epheſus Act. 20. 28. the Church of Epheſus had many Biſhops, to whom the charge of feeding and governing the whole flock did apperteine in comon &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Therefore at that time Timothy had not received ſuch an epiſcopall charge &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The aſſumption is manifeſt by the wordes of the Apoſtle Actes 20. 28. and the propoſition is moſte apparant by the manifeſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, betwixt the ſingular regiment of one Biſhop, and the joint charge of many. Moreover, it is juſtifyed by the Doctors ſecret allowance, (ſerm. pag. 18. &amp; 69.) and very plainly by him, that gave the Doctor beſt ſatiſfaction in this whole controverſy, perpet. govern. pag. 223. There was, ſaith he, a time when the Church was governed by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-advice of the Presbyters, as Ierom af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth. In this time ſpake Paul to the Presbyters at Epheſus, Act. 20. 28. Neyther let the Doctor think here to ſtopp our mouthes, with the ſhifting anſwer which he elſewhere uſeth, viz, that theſe Presbyters governed onely in private, &amp; as under the Apoſtle; who kept in his own hands the epiſcopall authoritie; for this is to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the Apoſtle himſelfe, who plainely reſigneth to them the whole charge of that Church, as knowing that he ſhould ſee them no more. verſ. 28. 32. with 25. 26. It is a cleare truth therefore, that Timothy not having then any ſole preheminence in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of that Church, was not their Biſhop; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he was not at all ordeyned their Biſhop, as is before ſhewed.</p>
                     <p>His allegations follow, from diverſe authors, which report of <note place="margin">Sect. 6. ad ſect. 10. p. 91.</note> Timothy and Titus that they lived and died, the one at Epheſus, the other in Creet. His Refuter told him, that he might credit the report of his authors, &amp; yet deny them to be dioceſan Biſhops; and good reaſon he had ſo to tell him; becauſe an epiſcopall functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on cannot be concluded from their living &amp; dying in that place. He now telleth us that it ſufficeth his purpoſe, to wit, to prove that they held their ordinary reſidence there, which the objection de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth; therefore againe I tell him, that vnleſſe he will fit the obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to his owne ſtrength; and ſo contend with his owne ſhadow, he muſt prove more then an ordinary reſidence; even a band of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance there, as their proper charge. For till this be effected,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:14068:269"/> his proofes are to as little purpoſe as thoſe that many papiſts al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge for Peters Biſhoprick at Rome; becauſe towards his later time, he there lived for his ordinarie reſidence, and at length there died. I adde this, to provoke the Doctor to a better examination of his owne witneſſes; that they doe not prove ſuch an ordinarie reſidence, as he would juſtify by them. For ſome of them, are worthy of no great credit, as Vincentius, Antonius, and Nicepho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, authors, on whom the leaden Leagend is grounded. And Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotheus one of the moſt ancient that he alledgeth is much abuſed.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Ergo, the making of Timothy and Titus Biſhops, when they were Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, was a thing which the Apoſtle neyther could nor would doe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The aſſumption is very ſcornfully rejected by the Doctor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in his imagination, the partes thereof are nice points, which none of the fathers did ever underſtand; but his triumph is vaine and vnſeaſonable, whiles we are in examining by the verdict of the ſcriptures, or by reaſon grounded thereon, what to determine of this controverſy. Wherefore, to paſſe by this anſwerleſſe anſwer, I will indeavour to draw the reader to the conſideration of that I haue to alleadge in defenſe of our aſſumption as followeth,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To conioyne the offices of Evangeliſts and Biſhops &amp; Pastors in one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon at one time, is to confound the offices which are distinguiſhed, Epheſ. 4. 11. And to take from an Evangeliſt his evangeliſticall function, when he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested into the office of a Biſhop or Pastor, aſſigned to the charge of one certein Church, is to deprive him of an higher, and to thruſt him into a lower calling.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But to make Timothy and Titus Bishops, when they were Evangeliſts, could not be done without, eyther conioyning both offices in one perſon, or taking their firſt office from them, when the later is given to them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ergo, neyther can it be done, without eyther confounding the offices, which are distinguiſhed Epheſ. 4. 11; or depriving them of the higher function; to thruſt them into a lower.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here the propoſition is impugned in both the branches therof, firſt therefore for the former thus I argue. <hi>It is apparant, by the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry text, Epheſ. 4. 11. and by other ſcriptures, that the ſeverall functions of Miniſtery there mencioned, were by Christ diſtributed to ſeverall perſons, &amp; not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted two or moe of them to one man at once. Ergo, to conioyne the offices of Evangeliſts and Biſhops, in one perſon at one time, is to confound the offices, which by God are diſtinguiſhed.</hi> For the manifeſtation of the antecedent, firſt let the text be weighed, Epheſ. 4. 11. 12. <hi>he gave ſome to be Apostles; and ſome Prophets, and ſome Evangeliſts, and ſome Paſtors and Teachers.</hi> He ſaith not, he gave ſome to be Paſtors onely, and ſome to be Evangeliſtes and Paſtors: or that ſome were Apoſtles onely; and ſome Apoſtles and Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, but (as before) he gave ſome to be Apoſtles, and ſome to be Evangeliſts &amp;c. thereby ſignifying that ſuch as had the calling of Apoſtles, had not alſo the office of Evangeliſts. Neyther did the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:14068:270"/> Evangeliſts holde therewithall the office of Paſtors. 2. This is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirmed by the ſimilitude which the Apoſtle vſeth (1. Cor. 12. 14,<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 28. of many members in one body, which haue (not all one and the ſame, but each of them, his ſeverall office. The eye is not an eare; neither doth it ſerve the body in the office of hearing, or ſmelling &amp;c. in like manner all are not Apoſtles, nor all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, &amp;c. but God hath ordeyned, ſome to one office, and ſome to another, as firſt Apoſtles, ſecondly Prophets, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>3. And of this diſtinction we haue examples. For touching the extraordinarie Miniſters (of Apoſtles, Prophets and Evangeliſts) we finde them diſtributed to ſeverall perſons. Luk. 16. 13. Act. 1. 26. and cap. 11. 27. 28. and 21. 8. And for ordinarie functions, there were at Ieruſalem Deacons and Elders. Act. 6. 3. 6. &amp; 11. 31. at Philippi, Biſhops and Deacons, Phil. 1. 1. but of two or moe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices combined in one perſon at once, there cannot be yeelded any one cleare example in holy ſcripture.</p>
                     <p>All that the Doct. objecteth to infringe this is of ſmall moment; viz. that as Apoſtles might be Evangeliſts, as we ſee in Mathew &amp; <note place="margin">Sect. 2.</note> Iohn; ſo Evangeliſts might be Biſhops, as we ſe in Mark. (pag. 95) For the name of Eva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geliſt by ancient or later writers given to Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew and Iohn, becauſe they wrote thoſe hiſtories, which are <hi>kat hexochen,</hi> called <hi>Evangelia,</hi> Goſpells; proveth not, that they had that functio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Evangeliſts, which is diſtinguiſhed from the Apoſtles, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ. 4. 11. The ſcripture is beſt expounded by the ſcripture; &amp; therefore we muſt by Evangeliſts there, vnderſtand ſuch as have the name given them in other partes of the new teſtament, as Acts. 21. 8. and 2. Tim. 4. 5. And as for Mark, we know him to be an Eva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt; not onely becauſe he wrote one of the 4. Goſpells; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe he was (as Timothy) a companion and fellow helper to the Apoſtles: but his Biſhoprick we diſclaime no leſſe then Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothees; and for the ſame reaſon, becauſe he was an Evangeliſt by his particular function: neither can the Doct. herein contradict us, without contradiction aſwell to himſelf as to the truth. For he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth (as the truth in deed is) that the word Evangeliſt ſpecially taken, ſignifieth the extraordinary fu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of thoſe in the primitive Church, which went up &amp; down preaching the Goſpell, not being affixed to any certeine place. And particularly, of Timothy &amp; Titus he ſaith, they were Evangeliſts whiles they accompanied the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle Paul in his traveiles, &amp; were not aſſigned to any certeine place.
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:14068:270"/> From hence therefore I thus frame a 2. argument; to prove, that the combyning of the functions of Evangeliſts and Biſhops; or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors in one perſon at once, is a confounding of offices, which by their firſt inſtitution; were diſtinguiſhed;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Whatſoever offices are ſevered by properties of an oppoſite nature; they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not at once be conjoyned in one perſon, without confounding the functio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which by their firſt inſtitution were diſtinguiſhed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But the function of Evangeliſts &amp; Biſhops are ſevered by properties of an oppoſite nature;</hi> (for the one is extraordinary, and not bound to any certeine place, the other is ordinarie &amp; tyed to one certeine place.)</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ergo the functions of Evangeliſts and Biſhops or Paſtors, cannot be conjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at once in one perſon, without confounding the functio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, which in their firſt inſtitution were diſtinguiſhed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And by this it may be ſeene that the Doctors compariſon halt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, when he would perſwade that Timothy and Titus might be Biſhops, although they were Evangeliſts like as the Apoſtles Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew and Iohn, were alſo Evangeliſts; for that Evangeliſtſhip given to Matthew &amp; Iohn by that name of Evangeliſts is farre differing from the Evangeliſticall function of Timothy and Titus, neyther is there ſuch an oppoſition betweene their Evangeliſt-ſhip, and the Apoſtleſhip; as there is betwene that Evangeliſtical function, which he giveth to Timothy &amp; Titus; &amp; their epiſcopall office. For Matthew and Iohn ceaſed not to be Apoſtles, when they became Evangeliſts: but concerning Timothy and Titus he plainely affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that they laid aſide their former office when they vndertook the later. For he ſaith (pag. 95.) <hi>that after they were placed Biſhops, they traveiled not up and downe, as in former times, but ordinarily remeyned with their flocks.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To come then to the latter braunch of the Refuters argument, <note place="margin">Sect. 3. ad ſect. 12. p. 95.</note> (which affirmeth, that they were deprived of an higher calling, &amp; thruſt into a lower, if they ceaſed to be Evangeliſts, when they were made Biſhops) the truth of it dependeth upon this aſſertion, that the Evangeliſts were in degree of miniſtery ſuperior to all ordinary Paſtors or Biſhops, which is ſo generally acknowledged for a truth, that the Reader may well admire at the Doctors boldnes, that ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not to ſet an Evangeliſt in equall ranck with preſbyters, and ſo (in his apprehenſion) in a degree below his Biſhops. For here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he ſwarveth not onely from the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon Tenent of the beſt, in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reformed churches, (ſee Calvin in Epheſ. 4. 11. Beza. de
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:14068:271"/> grad: miniſt: pag. 133. 134.) which give to all the extraordinary functions, of Apoſtles, Prophets and Evangeliſts, a preheminent degree above all the ordinary offices of Paſtors or Biſhops; but alſo from ſuch as have pleaded the ſame cauſe before him. (D. Dove, Def. of Church-government, pag. 17. lin. 18. and perpet gover. pag. 50. 51.) And therefore as the D. will have Iames to remeine an Apoſtle, though he were Biſhop of Ieruſalem: ſo will Biſhop Bilſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> have Timothy and Titus to be both Evangeliſts and Biſhops, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet. gover. pag. 233. 234. But to leave the mencion of men, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever famous for learning and eſteemed in the Church; can we have any better line, whereby to meaſure out the preheminence of each miniſteriall function, then that priority of place &amp; order, wherein the Apoſtles hath ſet them? Epheſ. 4, 11. from hence therefore, I thus argue.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>All the ordinary functions of miniſtery compriſed vnder the name of Paſtors, and Teachers; are in degree inferior to the extraordinary functions of Apoſtles, Prophets &amp; Evangelists; as the order of their ſtanding Epheſ. 4. 11. ſheweth. But the function of Biſhops which the Doct. aſcribeth to Timothy and Titus, is an ordinary function of ministery &amp; ſuch as himſelf comprizeth vnder the name of Pastors pag. 95. Ergo, it is alſo inferior in degree to the extraordinary functio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Evangelists aſwell as to Apoſtles &amp; Prophets.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now to reduce to this argument, the Doctors diſcourſe (pag. 94. and 95) the ſumme is this. Firſt he maketh. 4. ſorts of Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts. viz, ſuch as taught the Goſpell by writing, as the 4. Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, Math. Mark, Luke and Iohn. 2. any one that doth Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize or preach the Goſpell. 3. the. 72. diſciples imediately called of Chriſt and ſent by him to preach the goſpel; of which number was Philip, Act. 21. 8. 4. Some others aſſumed by the Apoſtles to be their companions in their traveiles, and aſſiſtants in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery; and of this ſort were Timothy and Titus, whiles they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied Paul in his traveiles and were not aſſigned to any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne place. Secondly to apply this diſtribution unto the Apoſtles meaning, Epheſ 4. 11.; he acknowledgeth no other there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized under the name of Evangeliſts; then the 4. Evangeliſts, ſo called <hi>kat hexochen,</hi> and perhaps the 72, doubtfully he ſpeaketh of them (pag. 95.) as being loath (it ſeemeth) to acknowledge, that they had any preheminence above his dioceſan Biſhops be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Fathers ſay of them (as he obſerveth pag. 94.) that they alſo had but the degree of the presbyterie. And therefore I gueſſe,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:14068:271"/> he will award the ſtroke of the former argument, by this diſtinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thus, viz. that the ordinary functions of miniſtery comprized vnder the name of Paſtors and Teachers, are not inferior in degree to the later ſort of Evangeliſts, which attended on the Apoſtles, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the 4. Evangeliſts, and perhaps to the. 72. becauſe theſe one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not the other, are meant by the name of Evangeliſts in that place.</p>
                     <p>And to joine iſſue with the Doctor, I affirme the contrary, viz. <note place="margin">Section <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>
                        </note> that by Evangeliſts in Epheſ. 4. 11. we are to vnderſtand all thoſe, and thoſe onely, which in an extraordinary function (diſtinct from the Apoſtles and Prophets) traveiled too and fro, preaching the Goſpell; whether they were imediately called of Chriſt; as Philip is ſuppoſed to be; or were aſſumed by the Apoſtles to be their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions and aſſiſtants, as Timothy, Titus, Mark and many others. And firſt to prove that which he denyeth, (viz. that the later ſort of Evangeliſts are comprized vnder that name in Epheſ. 4. 11. aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well as the former) for brevity ſake in ſtead of larger ſyllogiſmes, I tender to him and to the judicious Reader theſe ſeveral arguments nakedly propounded. 1. the D. confeſſeth that vnder the name of Evangeliſts ſpecially taken, the later ſort, (in which number Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and Titus were) are no leſſe comprized, then the former, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to them all, that they went up and downe preaching the Goſpell, not being affixed to any certeine place. It ſeemeth therefore, he was not well adviſed, when he admitted the one ſort and denied the other, to be underſtood by the word, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ. 4. 11. unleſſe he could yeeld (as he cannot) ſome ſufficient reaſon for the difference he putteth betweene them. 2. Againe, he confeſſeth that the later ſort were in an extraordinary function. Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther therefore he muſt deny all extraordinarie functions of mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie to be comprized Epheſ. 4. 11. or he muſt referre one ſort of Evangeliſts to an other name, as of Apoſtles, Prophets or Paſtors &amp;c. both which are abſurd, and I doubt not but to make good the cenſure, if the Doctor require it. Now whereas he referreth the word Evangeliſts, Epheſ. 4. 11. principally to thoſe 4. that wrote the goſpels; this is not eaſily proved, to accord with the meaning of the Apoſtle, ſeing that work of penning the Evangelicall hiſtory, maketh them not to ſtand in a differing function of Miniſterie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all others. For the Miniſteries there mencioned are all diſtinct fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of preachers; And if the writing of Chriſts hiſtorie made a
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:14068:272"/> different function; why ſhould not the writing of the Apoſtles Acts make a ſecond, and the writing of the Evangelicall, or Canonicall epiſtles, a third: and the receiving and penning of the revelation a 4. And as for the. 72. or rather 70. (For Luke mencioneth 70. not 72. choſen by Chriſt. cap. 10. 1.) how confident ſoever the Doct. be in aſſigning to them an Evangeliſticall function; yet we cannot haſtilie ſubſcribe to him therein; much leſſe can wee graunt that which he affirmeth of Philip, that he layd aſide the evangeliſticall function, to take a temporary Deaconſhip Act. 6. and ſo returned to it againe: but theſe are <hi>parerga,</hi> by-controverſies about which we will not contend.</p>
                     <p>Let us therefore attend to the reaſon urged by the D. to prove, <note place="margin">Sect. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

For how will he prove, 1. that they were before but presbyters, <note place="margin">The D. beg geth 3. times to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in one ſentence. &amp;c.</note> 2. called Evangeliſts in a larger ſenſe; 3. now made Apoſtles of thoſe Churches. 4. and by impoſition of hands made Biſhops? The two laſt are nakedly ſent forth, without any one ragge to cover their ſhame; the ſecond is a manifeſt contradiction to the truth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore acknowledged by himſelfe pag. 94. where he comprizeth Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy and Titus, no leſſe then Philip and ſome others, under the name of Evangeliſts, ſpecially taken for the extraordinarie functio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of thoſe that went up and downe, preaching the goſpell, being not affixed to any certain place. And this truth thus acknowledged convinceth his firſt aſſertio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a palpable falſhood.

                        </gap> abuſe the fathers, in making them the authors of his owne para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxe? For, doe they match the 72 diſciples, or any other Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, with the degree of Presbyters any otherwiſe, then they doe the Apoſtles, with the degree or place of Biſhops? Neyther is this done to ſet the Evangeliſts below Biſhops, or to lift up Biſhops a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Prophets, but to countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce that ſuperioritie, which in their times Biſhops held above Presbyters; by a compariſon of the like
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:14068:272"/> difference, which they apprehended betweene the Apoſtles, &amp; the 70. diſciples. Wee haue therefore better arguments to prove the contrary aſſertion. viz. That Timothy and Titus were in degree ſuperiour to all ordinarie presbyters; for (beſides that already ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from Epheſ. 4. 11.) it is apparant by that honour which the Apoſtle, and by that obedience, which the Churches, to which they were ſent, gave unto them, whiles they were his fellow-hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers and companions in his traveiles. 1. Cor. 4. 17. &amp; 16. 10. 16. 2. Cor. 1. 1. &amp; 7. 13. 15. &amp; 8. 23. Philip. 1. 1. and 2. 20. 22. Wherefore I conclude once againe, that to make them Paſtors or Biſhops; when they were Evangeliſts, is (not to advance them but rather) to throw them downe from a higher degree of Miniſterie to a lower.</p>

Tim. 4. 14. &amp; 2. Tim. 1. 6.) and which the Fathers underſtand of his ordination to be Biſhop.</hi> I graunt that Paul mentioneth hands-impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on Timothy &amp; that ſome of the fathers doe thereby underſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d his ordination to be Biſhop. Notwithſtanding I ſay he cannot prove eyther from thoſe words, or any of the fathers writings, that the impoſition of hands mencioned by Paul was a ſecond ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a new office, or a furniſhing of him, with any new Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall authoritie which before he wanted. What the Fathers ſpeak of his ordination to be Biſhop, may be conſtrued (as is before no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning Iames) their ſpeaches are, which ſay that Iames was ordeyned Biſhop of Ieruſalem) of a new or differing imployment in the work of the Miniſterie, for the temporarie charge he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, which argueth no new authoritie or office impoſed on him. 2. And whereas he asketh <hi>whether men were admitted to the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary function of Evangeliſts by the ordinary meanes of impoſing hands?</hi> his owne pen hath given him a direct anſwer pag. 94. lin. 32. where he ſaith, that Timothy and Titus (who were of the later ſort of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts, and therefore in an extraordinary function (lin. 15. of the ſame page) were ordeyned Miniſters of the goſpell by impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

                     <p>3. Againe, he asketh, <hi>may we think that any but the Apoſtles (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not aſſigned as Biſhops to ſeverall Churches) had that authoritie where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they became, which Timothy had at Epheſus &amp; Titus in Creet?</hi> And he addeth, <hi>verily Philip the Evangeliſt had not authoritie to impoſe handes for the furniſhing of men with graces for the Miniſterie; but the Apoſtles Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Iohn were ſent to Samaria for that purpoſe. Act.</hi> 8. 5.-17. If it be his drift thus to argue; <hi>Philip the Evangelist had no authoritie, to give graces fit for the Miniſtery by impoſition of handes: Therefore beſides the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles none but Biſhops, had that authoritie whereſoever they came, which Timothy and Titus had at Epheſus and in Creet;</hi> I anſwer his reaſoning is many wayes faulty. For he cannot prove, eyther that Biſhops have, or that Timothy and Titus had, that authoritie by impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hands to give ſuch graces. Neyther is it true (which his words import) that the gifts of the holy Ghoſt given by the hands of Peter and Iohn (Act 8. 17.) were graces fitting the perſons that received them, to the work of the Miniſterie. Wherefore although it ſhould be graunted, that the Evangeliſt Philip had no authoritie to give thoſe peculiar graces; yet he might haue as great authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whereſoever he came, as Timothy and Titus had in the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of Epheſus and Creet; ſo that his aſſertion implyed in his quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion (viz. that beſides the Apoſtles, onely Biſhops had the like au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to that which Timothy and Titus had) hath no colour of any ſound reaſon to uphold it. Yea it is ſtrongly confuted by that which he ſeemeth to applaud in Zanchy on Epheſ. 4. 11. (pag. 95) viz. that the former ſort of Evangeliſts, and the Prophets alſo did governe the Churches nowe one, then an other. For how ſhould Churches be governed by them, if they had not the like power and authoritie for government that Timothy and Titus had?</p>
                     <p>From the Doctors reaſoning, in defenſe of his owne aſſertion, <note place="margin">Sect. 7. ad pag. 96.</note> let us paſſe to the anſwer yeelded by him to his Refut: who argued in this manner, <hi>Timothy and Titus were to exerciſe their Evangelisticall function in thoſe places. (For Paul biddeth Timothy after he had bin at Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus to do the worke of an Evangeliſt) Ergo they receyved no new authority at their placing there, which they had not before; neyther laid they aſide but retey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſtill their Evangeliſticall function.</hi> The Doctor denyeth the Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:14068:273"/> and contradicteth the proofe thereof. Whereas Paul willeth Timothy to doe the work of an Evangeliſt, <hi>what is thee,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>but</hi> evaggelizeſthai, <hi>to preach the Goſpell diligently. &amp;c. the word Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt being there taken in the generall ſenſe?</hi> Here we are put to prove that the name of an Evangeliſt is here taken, not in a generall ſenſe; but in a more ſpeciall for the function of an Evangeliſt; which may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by theſe circumſtances. 1. Firſt the very phraſe it ſelfe, <hi>to doe the work of an Evangeliſt,</hi> cannot in reaſon be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrued otherwiſe, then q. d. to doe the work which an Evangeliſt is bound vnto, by his particular function; like as in the like phraſe, <hi>the work of an Apostle, the ſignes of an Apostle, the commandement of the Apostles,</hi> and the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Apoſtles. 1. Cor. 1. 9. 2. Cor. 12. 12. 2. Pet. 3. 2. &amp; Epheſ. 2. 20. the name of an Apoſtle is ſpecially taken for the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Apoſtleſhip. 2. It is the Apoſtles purpoſe (ſee Mr. Calvin upon the place) by the honorable mencion of his office, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him to uſe the greater diligence therein, thereby to gaine the greater reverence among thoſe, that ſhould behold his zeale and faithfulnes in his calling. But the ſpeciall function of an Evangeliſt, ſerveth better, then the generall name of a preacher of the Goſpel, both to animate him vnto watchfulnes, and to procure him autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity amongſt thoſe, with whom he converſed. 3. Moreover ſince it is knowne and confeſſed, that he was once an Evangeliſt; if either he had ceaſed ſo to be, or if he had borne at this time a more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable office, (as the Doctor ſuppoſeth) in all likelihood, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle would have give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him ſome other title, leaſt others ſhould be led into an error by this name.</p>
                     <p>4. Laſtly, if we looke to the uſe of the word <hi>evaggelistes</hi> in other places we ſhal find it no where carried in the Apoſtolicall writings to a generall ſignification as the Doctor fancieth; but rather is appropriated to that extraordinary function of Evangeliſts, which then was knowne by that name as Act. 21. 8. &amp; Eph. 4. 11. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſince it is a firme &amp; vndoubted axiome in divinity, that we are to receive that interpretation of any word or phraſe, which beſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordeth with the ſcope of the place, it ſelfe, and the uſe of the like in other places, I will hold it for a truth not to be gainſayd, that the word <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> ought here to be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (not in the generall ſenſe but) for the ſpeciall function of an Evangeliſt knowne by that name.</p>
                     <p>We now come to Zuinglius his teſtimonie, alleadged by the D. <note place="margin">Sect. 8. ad pag. 97.</note>
                        <pb n="134" facs="tcp:14068:274"/> to prove that their being Evangeliſts, did not hinder them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Biſhops. His caſe is very deſperate (it ſeemeth) ſince he is drive<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to crave releefe of one ſo well knowne to be a profeſſed enemie to to the Lordly juriſdiction of Dioceſan and Provincial Prelates. But what Zuinglius? forſooth, that Philip the Evangeliſt who had bene one of the Deacons, was afterwards Biſhop of Caeſarea, and Iames the Apoſtle was Biſhop of Ieruſalem, and divers of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, when they ceaſed from their peregrinations, became Biſhops of certayne Churches. <hi>Which</hi> ſaith the D, <hi>may be much more verified of the Evangeliſts;</hi> In deed if this laſt gloſe, had bene Zuinglius his words, his evidence had bene farre ſitter for his purpoſe then it is, and yet would it haue done him no ſervice till he had proved that Timothy and Titus had given over their Evangeliſticall traveiles, which he will never be able to effect, while he breatheth. But now, all that Zuinglius ſpeaketh for him, is ſuch as (if he rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his meaning) he will be very loth (I ſuppoſe) to ſubſcribe unto. For he is ſo farre from affirming (as the Doctor intimateth to his reader) that Philip after his Deaconſhip, was firſt an Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt, and after that became the Biſhop of Caeſarea; that he rather citeth thoſe words of Luke, Act. 21. 8. (where he is called an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſt) to prove him to be a Biſhop: for theſe are his wordes (De eccleſiaſtica ſive ratione et officio co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cionandi. fol. 48.) <hi>Quo in loco illud nobis primo notandum eſt, Philippum hunc Caeſarienſis eccleſiae E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſtam, epiſcopum vel pastorem fuiſſe &amp;c.</hi> In which place, that is firſt of us to be noted, <hi>that this Philip the Evangeliſt of the Church of Samaria, was Biſhop or Paſtor &amp;c.</hi> whereby it appeareth, as alſo by the words afeerwards remembred by the Doctor <hi>(conſtat iuxta Pauli ſententiam idem eſſe epiſcopi, et Evangeliſtae officium)</hi> and by many other ſpeaches in that treatiſe, that he confoundeth the names of Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſtes Prophets &amp; Paſtors in one office. But let us ſee how the D. removeth the Refuters anſwere. Firſt he ſaith that Zuinglius ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth according to the phraſe of hiſtories &amp; other ancient writers, who take not the name of Biſhop properly, when they give it to Iames or any other Apoſtle (as Doct. Whitak. hath rightly obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <note place="margin">The Doct. reaſoneth from that which is no cauſe &amp;c. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfully.</note> de pontif. rom. pag. 303,) the Doctor replyeth. <hi>

                           </gap>. that if Zuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glius spake according to the phraſe of histories &amp;c. then and (therefore) he spake according to the truth:</hi> from whence I inferre that if Zuinglius have ſpoken the truth in this matter, then the Doctor is in an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and reaſoneth deceitfully <hi>a non cauſa pro cauſa.</hi> For whereas he
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:14068:274"/> would perſwade that Iames was properly a Biſhop, becauſe the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſo intititle him. Zuinglius ſaith expreſly of Iames <hi>Hunc Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron: et omnes ſimul vetuſti patres, Hieroſol: epiſcopum nominant non aliam ab cauſam, quam quod in ea urbe ſedem fixam poſuiſſet.</hi> Ierom and with him all the ancient farhers, call him Biſhop of Ieruſalem, for no other cauſe, but for that he had made his fixed aboad in that citie.</p>
                     <p>2. The Doctor asketh; <hi>Although it be true that the Apostles could not properly be called Biſhops, what is that to Timothy and Titus, whom he hath proved to have bene particularly aſſigned to the Ch: of Epheſus &amp; Creet, where alſo they lived &amp; dyed?</hi> I anſwer, hath he not by as good proofs ſhewed Iames his aſſignement to the Church of Ieruſalem and his living and dying there? If then (all this notwithſtanding) it be true that Iames was not properly a Biſhop, doth he not reaſon looſely, when from ſuch aſſignement of Timothy and Titus, he concludeth them to be properly Biſhops? The refuters ſecond anſwere is, <hi>that it is manifeſt by Zuinglius his writings, he neyther thought they were, nor any other might be a dioceſan Biſhop.</hi> Whereto the Doctor replyeth, <hi>belike he spake otherwiſe then he thought,</hi> and then addeth an other teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Zuinglius, which ſaith, <hi>that Timothy was a Biſhop and that the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of an Evangeliſt and of a Biſhop is all one:</hi> where behold with what conſcience the Doctor wreſteth the words of his owne witneſſe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their meaning; for there is nothing more evident to them that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe Zuinglius his writings then this; that with him every preacher of the goſpell at this day, hath as good right to the name of an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſt, and of a Biſhop, as to the title of a presbyter or paſtor: <hi>vocat ad ſe Paulus Act. 20. preſbyter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>FRom theſe two objections (in the purſute whereof, the Doctor <note place="margin">Sect. 1. ad ſect. 13. pag. 98.</note> fedd himſelfe with a vaine hope, to gaine ſome advantage) he now returneth to give a freſh onſet on his Adverſary in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The ſuppoſed Evangeliſticall function of Timothy &amp; Titus, was to ende with their perſons, and admitted no ſucceſſion: as being both extraordinary &amp; temporary.</hi> But the function and authority which they had as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſigned to certeine Churches <hi>viz. of Epheſus and of Creet (conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting specially in the power of ordination &amp; juriſdiction) was not to ende with their parſons, but to be continued in their ſucceſſors. Therefore the function and authority which Timothy &amp; Titus had, as being aſſigned to Epheſus and Creet; was not extraordinary and Evangeliſticall.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This argument (layd downe, ſerm. pag. 79.) his Refuter tooke to be oppoſed againſt the Antecedent of that objection which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth Timothy and Titus to be Evangeliſts; and who would not have ſo judged, ſeing the concluſion denyeth their function &amp; authority to be Evangeliſticall. But he ſaith that the introduction premiſed before this argument <hi>(hereof we may conclude thus)</hi> ſheweth that he intended not to deny or diſprove that Antecedent, but to bring a new ſupply of argument to prove that Timothy and Titus were Biſhops of Epheſus &amp; Creet. Which difference I referre whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the judgment of the indifferent reader, not doubting but he will diſcharge the Refuter from all blame eyther of willfull, or of negligent miſtaking. And whereas he flatly denieth that he <hi>doth deny they were Evangeliſts;</hi> that he may not hide himſelfe under a cloud, I deſire him plainely to anſwere us, whither they remayned Evangeliſts after that calling, which he ſuppoſeth they had to be Biſhops? If yea, why doth he inſinuate the contrary (pag. 95. lin. 24. &amp;c.) when to juſtify this, <hi>that they were not Evangelists, but Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors and Bps,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>that after they were placed the one in Epheſus, the other in Creet, they traveiled not vp and downe as in former tymes, when they
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:14068:275"/> accompanied the Apoſtles, but ordinarily remayned with their flocks.</hi> If no, why maketh he his Reader beleeve, that in the concluſion of his argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t above mencioned, he neyther doth nor did intend to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that they were Evangeliſts. But (as often before ſo here againe) we muſt and will follow him in his owne way, when he ſaith <hi>his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe was from the former concluſion thus to argue;</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The function and authority which Timothy and Titus exerciſed in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus and Creet, was eyther extraordinary and Evangeliſticall, as the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plinarians teach: or elſe ordinary, and epiſcopall as the prelatiſts affirme: But it was not extraordinary and evangeliſticall. Therefore ordinary and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopall.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here the aſſumption is the concluſion of the former argument; and the propoſition he taketh for granted, as if it fully delivered the points of difference, betweene us and him with his Aſſociates in the cauſe he pleadeth. Wherefore we muſt take leave to lay downe our owne opinion more clearely, which is this in few words. Firſt we diſtinguiſh function from authority; both which the Doct. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundeth; for though we affirme, their function there exerciſed to be Evangeliſticall and therefore extraordinary; yet we doe not ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouch of their whole authority nor yet of that authority or power of ordination &amp; juriſdiction, whereof he ſpeaketh in the aſſumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his former argument; as the Doct. may perceive by the Refuters words, whereof he tooke notice pag. 84. Againe, we diſtinguiſh betwixt <hi>authority</hi> (ſimply conſidered and in generall) to performe the works of preaching, and ordeyning &amp;c. And that particular or perſonall authority which for the exerciſe of theſe works, was inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in their perſons; and gave them allowance in all places where they came to exerciſe the works of their calling: And therefore though we grant (as before is noted) the authority it ſelfe in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracto &amp; ſimply conſidered) to be ordinarily and perpetually ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary: yet we affirme their perſonall authority to be Evangeliſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, becauſe all the authority they had did flow from their Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſticall function. For like as the Apoſtles preached and baptized by the authority of their Apoſtleſhip; ſo did Timothy &amp; Titus both Preach and impoſe hands &amp;c. by vertue of their Evangeliſtſhip. So then to make anſwer, firſt to the D. diſjunctive argument, 1. as touching the function which Timothy &amp; Titus exerciſed in Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus and Creet, we affirme it to be extraordinary and Evangeliſticall; and therefore in that reſpect utterly reject his Aſſumption. 2. tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:14068:276"/> their authoritie (conſiſting as he ſaith ſpecially in ordinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and juriſdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) if he take it perſonally for that which was inveſted in them, by the miniſteriall functio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which they there exerciſed: then I reject the aſſumption alſo in that behalfe: but if it be taken ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and at large for any authoritie to exerciſe the like works; eyther in the ſame Churches or in any other; then I diſclaime his propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. For we are ſo farre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> affirming this authoritie, to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per vnto Evangeliſts; that we hold it rather co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to every Paſtor, in his owne congregation. Let the reader ſee what the Doctor ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth for this purpoſe pag. 79. &amp; 84. and what we have added, (cap. 8. ſect. 12) touching their preheminence above other Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and the continuance thereof, in the preſidents of Synods.</p>
                     <p>Now to come to his Argument firſt ſet downe, (and to paſſe by that fault, of mencioning function onely in the propoſition; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <note place="margin">Sect. 2. ad pag. 98. 99.</note> authoritie is alſo joyned with it in the aſſumption and concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) the Aſſumption which was denyed by the Refuter, muſt (for the clearing of his true meaning) be divided into two me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers, the one ſerving properly for the plaine &amp; naturall aſſumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. viz. that the function and authoritie which they exerciſed in Epheſus and Creete, was not to end with their perſons; but to be continued in their ſucceſſors: the other ſerving eyther for the Medius terminus of a proſyllogiſm to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firm the former; or at leaſt for an explicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his meaning therin. viz. that the functio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; authoritie which they had or exerciſed in thoſe Churches, was ſuch as aſſigned them to the particular care thereof, and conſiſted ſpecially in the power of ordination and juriſdiction: the refuter (for brevitie ſake omitting, to diſtinguiſh theſe two differing propoſitions infolded in one) fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his anſwer to the later, affirming (as the truth is) that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he doth but begge the queſtion; in aſmuch as he aſſumeth for <note place="margin">The Doct. beggeth.</note> truth theſe two points before convinced of falſhood. viz. 1. that they were aſſigned to the perpetuall charge of thoſe Churches. 2. And that their authoritie was ſuch a preheminent power in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and juriſdiction, as he aſcribeth elſwhere to Biſhops. If pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice (or rather malice as it may be feared) had not blinded the Doctor, he might have aſwell diſcerned this, as ſome others have done, that borrowed no light from the Refuter by any private co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with him, to finde out his true meaning, and then he might have ſpared that outragious calumniation <hi>He roves and raves as men uſe to doe, which being at a non-plus would faine ſeeme to anſwer ſomewhat.</hi>
                        <pb n="139" facs="tcp:14068:276"/> But to anſwere his Aſſumption, as he hath now nakedly propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it, (viz. that the function and authoritie which they exerciſed in Epheſus and Creete, was not to end with their perſons, but to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued in their ſucceſſors.) I anſwer, with the diſtinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before uſed, to wit that their perſonall authoritie, periſhed with their fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and therefore in that reſpect the aſſumption is falſe; howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there remayned unto perpetuall ſucceſſion an authoritie to performe the ſame miniſteriall works, which they exerciſed by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of their temporary function. So that, if he will prove the aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption in that ſenſe wherein it is denyed: then muſt he prove the perpetuitie (not onely of their authoritie in generall, and for the works ſake which they performed, but alſo) of their particular fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and of that perſonall authoritie, which they there exerciſed; ſo as neyther the one nor the other did end with their perſons, but was continued in their ſucceſſors; the proofe therefore of his aſſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption muſt thus runne,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That function and authoritie which is ordinary and perpetually neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, not onely for the welbeing, but alſo for the very being of the viſible Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es: was not to end with the perſons of Timothy and Titus, but to be continued in their ſucceſſors.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But the function and authoritie which they exerciſed in Epheſus &amp; Creet, is ordinary and perpetually neceſſary, not onely for the wel-being, but alſo for the very being of the viſible Churches.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Therefore the function and authoritie which they there exerciſed, was not to end in their perſons; but to be continued in their ſucceſſors.</hi>

                     <p>Here the Aſſumption was denied; becauſe however the power of ordination and juriſdiction be perpetually neceſſary; yet there is no neceſſitie, that there ſhould be in every Church an Evangeliſt (that is to ſay, one indowed with that peculiar function &amp; perſonall authoritie which Timothy and Titus had) for the good ordering and executing of that power. The Doctor ſaith, <hi>he did not affirme that which is denyed,</hi> ſcz. <hi>that there must be an Eva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gelist in every Church:</hi> neyther is he willing to ſee, that his aſſumption doth both in effect affirm as much; &amp; plainely avouche, what he dareth not to juſtify, to wit, that the very function which Timothy and Titus exerciſed, is perpetually neceſſarie, not onely for the wel-being; but alſo for the very being of the viſible Churches.</p>
                     <p>To avoid this groſſe abſurditie, he will needes now divide their <note place="margin">Sect. 3. ad ſect. 14. pag 100. 101.</note> function from their authoritie; which hitherto he hath conjoyned.
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:14068:277"/> For thus he explaineth his Aſſumption. <hi>The function which Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and Titus exerciſed was ordinary; and their authoritie perpetually neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary &amp;c.</hi> of which two points he ſaith, <hi>his Refuter graunteth the later, &amp; doth not touch the former;</hi> as if the former branch could eſcape his touch, when his whole aſſumption is rejected as falſe; or there were no difference, betwixt that power of ordination and juriſdiction in generall, which the Refuter graunteth to be perpetually neceſſary; and that peculiar authoritie, which was inveſted in Timothy and Titus, by reaſon of their particular function, which was before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied to be continued in their ſucceſſors. But in truth, (as he hath <note place="margin">O ſweet D</note> now diſtributed and conſtrued the parts of his aſſumption,) in the ſecond he idly affirmeth, what was never denied; and ſo leaveth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched the point which he ſhould have proved: And in the firſt, he offendeth more groſly, for he borroweth the concluſion of his firſt argument, to make good the Aſſumption of the ſame. Before he proved the function of Timothy &amp; Titus to be ordinary &amp; epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall; becauſe it was not extraordinary and evangeliſticall: And now to prove that their function was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued in their ſucceſſors, and therefore not extraordinarie and Evangeliſticall, he telleth vs, that it is an ordinarie function and the ſame, which the Biſhops that ſucceeded them, did exerciſe. And to make a mends for this <note place="margin">The Doct. beggeth.</note> impudent begging, he multiplyeth his default, by heaping up many aſſertions, whereof ſome are apparantly falſe, and the reſt no leſſe doubtfull, then the point which he indeavoreth to juſtify. For firſt, it is falſe which he ſaith of Timothy and Titus; <hi>that in them there was nothing extraordinarie, but their not limitation to any certain chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;</hi> &amp; ſo is that which he addeth to prove it, viz. <hi>that their calling to the Miniſtery was ordinary, and their gifts attayned by ordinary meanes,</hi> for himſelf interpreteth the Apoſtles words 1. Tim. 4. 14. (neglect not the gift that is in thee &amp; was give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the by propheſie &amp;c. of his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to the Miniſtery, not by humane ſuffrage; but by divine revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement or oracle of the Holy Ghoſt (lib. 4. p. 141.) his calling therefore to the Miniſtery (by his own confeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) muſt be extraordinarie. 2. Neyther can it be denied to be extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie in Titus, that the Apoſtle co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to his Church, the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing of his owne work, for the firſt eſtabliſhing of the Churches in Creta, and furniſhing them with Biſhops or Elders to inſtruct them. For himſelf confeſſeth that the Churches which were yet in conſtituting, and vnfurniſhed with Presbyters to teach them, had
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:14068:277"/> no need of a Biſhop to govern them. Lib. 4. pag. 63. 3. In like manner this large commiſſion not confined to any one Church or Dioceſe, but with equall charge extended over all the Churches in the whole Iland, was more then ordinarie: ſeing the ordinary Biſhops and Elders were reſtreyned, to the overſight of one onely Church or flock; as appeareth by Act. 20. 28. &amp; 14. 23. Phil. 1. 1. and the Doctor that hath ſought all records he could meet with, for the next ſucceſſors of Titus, can finde none, that had the like extent of juriſdiction, till the next age after the Apoſtles; and yet there is an apparant difference, betweene him that the Doct. men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cioneth, and Titus as is before obſerved cap. 8. ſect. 13. next be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this. 4. Moreover it was extraordinarie that Timothy &amp; Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus were authorized to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund and to ſpeake with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manding authoritie. 1. Tim. 1. 3, &amp; 4. 11. &amp; 5. 7. Tit. 2. 15. for the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Biſhops knewe, that this was rather Apoſtolike, then ſuting with the function of Biſhops: (Ignatius in ep: ad Rom. knowing his owne meaſure would not commaund as an Apoſtle but exhort &amp;c.) but becauſe theſe men by their daily converſation with the Apoſtle, knew perfectly his doctrine and doings, the Paſtors of the Churches to which they were ſent, were to receive direction fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, and to yeeld obedience to their inſtructions. 1. Cor. 4. 17. &amp; 16, 10. 16. 2. Cor. 7 13. 2. Tim. 2. 2. &amp; 3. 10. 5. Yea even in gifts and the way of attayning them, D. Downames Betters doe acknowledge this extraordinarie preheminence; <hi>that they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with extrordinarie gifts, as the revealing of ſecrets; and diſcerning of ſpirits; and that they had their knowledge for the most part infuſed by revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> perpet. govern. pag. 88. Biſhop Barlow. ſerm. in Act. 20. 28 fol. 6. And ſince ſome of theſe extraordinarie preheminences, then ſhined moſt clearly when they were aſſigned, to the Churches of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus and Creet, it followeth inevitably that their function was even at that time extraordinarie, and therefore not epiſcopall, but evangeliſticall.</p>
                     <p>Now whereas he ſaith, <hi>that their function was the ſame ordinary fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which their ſucceſſors, &amp; all other Presbyters did exerciſe; becauſe. 1. they were aſſigned to certeine Churches as the Paſtors thereof. 2. ordeyned thereto by impoſition of hands. 3. and by that ordination, furniſhed with the power of ordination and juriſdiction;</hi> what elſe doth he then indeavor to juſtify the point controverted, by others, no leſſe doubtfull, if not apparantly falſe.</p>
                     <pb n="142" facs="tcp:14068:278"/>
                     <p>To returne now to that aſſumption, which at the firſt affirmed joyntly, <hi>that the very function of Timothy &amp; Titus, aſwell as their authority</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Sect. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>was both ordinary and perpetually neceſsary &amp;c.</hi> it is moſt plaine, by the reaſon added in his ſermon (pag. 79. before he bringeth in his concluſion) that he then intended (as his wordes ſignifyed) to juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify the perpetuity of their function for the wordes of his reaſon are theſe; <hi>If whiles the Apoſtles themſelves lived, it was neceſſary that they ſhould ſubſtitute in the Churches already planted, ſuch as Timothy &amp; Titus, furniſhed with epiſcopall power; then much more after their deceaſe, have the Churches need of ſuch governours.</hi> To this connexive propoſition him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe addeth the aſſumption, and concluſion pag. 104. following. <hi>But the former is evident by the Apoſtles practiſe in Epheſus &amp; Creet, and all other Apostolicall Churches. Therefore the latter may not be denyed.</hi> With what face now, can the Doctor deny, that this argument ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth at the perpetuall neceſſity (for all Churches) not onely of that authority or power, which he calleth epiſcopall; but alſo of the very office or function of Biſhops, ſuch as he affirmeth Timothy &amp; Titus to have bin? His complaint therefore is very injurious, (as we have elſwhere ſhewed to the full) when he chargeth his Refuter with wronging him in ſaying, that he maketh this epiſcopal power perpetually neceſſary, for the very being of the viſible Churches; &amp; that he contradicteth himſelfe in another place, when he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth that where the epiſcopall government may not be had, an other may be admitted.</p>
                     <p>But albeit the Doctor be loth to confeſſe himſelfe guilty; yet is it a ſigne of remorſe that he refuſeth; to mainteine that neceſſity of the epiſcopall function, which his argument at firſt directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded. Howbeit he proceedeth in falſe accuſation againſt his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futer in ſaying, he doth but elude his reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with a malepert ſpeach, <hi>becauſe he wiſhed him, not to wave &amp; crave, but to prove the question,</hi> for doth he not <hi>crave</hi> rather then prove, that which he aſſumeth for an <note place="margin">The D. wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth and craveth &amp; daunceth the round.</note> evident truth; when he giveth us no other argument, then his owne naked affirmance <hi>(that it is evident &amp;c.)</hi> to juſtify the aſſumption or Antecedent of his reaſon (viz. that it was neceſſary whiles the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles lived to ſubſtitute in the churches already planted men fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with epiſcopall power, &amp; therein like to Timothy &amp; Titus? And doth he not <hi>wave</hi> to and fro, or rather goe back againe to the firſt point controverted in this whole Chapter; when he avouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the ſame Aſſumption; that Timothy &amp; Titus were furniſhed
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:14068:278"/> with epiſcopall power; when the Apoſtle Paul ſubſtituted them in the churches of Epheſus and Creet? Wherefore, if his drift were, in this diviſion, ſuch as he avoucheth in the entrance thereof (viz. by a new ſupply of arguments to prove Timothy &amp; Titus to have bene Biſhops of Epheſus and Creet) the iſſue of all his reaſoning is no better then a plaine dancing the round, in this faſhion. Their function and authoritie was epiſcopall, becauſe it was not Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſticall; for it died not with their perſons; and therefore was not Evangeliſticall. It died not with their perſons, becauſe it was ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie and perpetually neceſſary &amp;c. for if it were neceſſarie to have men furniſhed with epiſcopall power, whiles the Apoſtles lived: it was much more neceſſary, after their deathes. Now that it was neceſſarie whiles they lived, it is evident by the Apoſtles practiſe in furniſhing Timothy and Titus, with epiſcopall power, at Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus and in Creet. Who ſeeth not (by all this his diſcourſe) that we are now juſt where we began? All this waving therefore from one argument to another in ſhewe; is but to dazell the eyes of his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that he might not diſcerne his groſſe begging. For in effect, this is all he can ſay, They were furniſhed with epiſcopall power: &amp; therefore their authoritie was epiſcopall: or, S. Paul made them Biſhops, and therefore they were Biſhops of his ordeyning.</p>
                     <p>As for thoſe two queſtions which he debateth Sect. 15. &amp; 16. (viz whether it be perpetually neceſſary, that the ſway of the eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall authoritie ſhould be in one? and what forme of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>government is to be preferred as the beſt? I forbeare to follow him in thoſe digreſſions. His reſolution to the former being negative, doth ſcarce accord with the concluſion of his laſt argument; which affirmeth that ſuch governors, as were Timothy &amp; Titus (in his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion) furniſhed with epiſcopall power, are much more neceſſarie after the Apoſtles death, then in their life time. But his reſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the later, is grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded on ſuch a reaſon, as wil put life againe into the ſame; if there were an undoubted truth in it. For could he prove the Monarchicall government of Bps, to be of divine inſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (as he affirmeth) it would follow, not onely that it is the beſt forme of Church-government; but alſo neceſſarily to be continued. And as I nothing feare to graunt him that conſequence; ſo I knowe he boaſteth in vain of warrant in the ſcriptures for the epiſcopall fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. He hath ſought for it, firſt in the Angels of the 7. chueches; then in Pauls approbation of Archippus, &amp; Epaphroditus; he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:14068:279"/> to Iames his preſidence at Ieruſalem; &amp; now he hath done all he can to prove it by the Apoſtles ordeyning Timothy &amp; Titus to the function of Biſhops. In all which diſputations of his, I have clearely ſhewed that the ſcriptures give him no colour for his aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. We are therefore now ready to liſten to thoſe teſtimonies of antiquity; which (if we might beleeve him) with a generall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent beare witnes to his aſſertion; <hi>that Timothy was Biſhop of Epheſus &amp; Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus of Creet.</hi>

                     <p>FIrſt he alleadgeth the ſubſcriptions, annexed to the end of the <note place="margin">Sect. 1. ad ſect. 17. pa. 105.</note> epiſtle to Titus, &amp; of the ſecond to Timothy; wherein the one is ſayd to have bin ordeyned the firſt Biſhop of the Church of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſians; and the other, the firſt Biſhop of the Church of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans. Being asked by his Refuter whether he thought them to be of the Canon, or added by the Apoſtle; he ſignifieth <hi>that he is not of that opinion.</hi> Whence I inferre that their evidence can never juſtify his maine purpoſe, which is to prove that the function of dioceſan Biſhops, is of divine inſtitution. But he ſaith, <hi>It is certeine they are of great antiquity, and of better credit then the Refuter; &amp; other diſciplinarians would make them.</hi> If it be certeine, their antiquity is great, &amp; their credit very good, why doth not the D. give us the proofs whereon he groundeth his certeinty? Firſt, for their antiquity, they deſerve not that preheminence, which he giveth them, to be heard before Euſebius &amp; the reſt of the fathers, which he alleadgeth for the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of the moſt ancient Syriac; and the old latin tranſlations found no mencion of an epiſcopall ordination beſtowed on Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy &amp; Titus in the greek copies which they followed. And yet the books which the old latin Interpreter imbraced, doe fully accord in the ſubſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of all the former epiſtles, with thoſe latter copies, into which that clauſe of that Biſhoprick was foiſted in. If therefore their credit have not ſome better ſupport, then their antiquity, their evidence is little worth. The Doct. greateſt labour in defenſe of their credit, is, to remove out of the way his Refuters objection, who ſaith, <hi>The ſubſcription ſet vnder the epiſtle to Titus (affirming it to be written from Nicopolis) is contrary to Pauls owne words.

The Rhemiſts may freely controull the ſubſcriptions of ſundry other e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles, becauſe they are not parties in this cauſe; (ſee their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. on. 1. Cor. &amp; 2. Cor. Gal. 1. and 2. Theſſ. and 1. Tim. for the place whence the epiſtles were ſent) But Mr. Beza can have no indifferent hearing; his reaſons are but Cavillations. But heare I pray, how the Doctor confuteth him. <hi>If you will,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>conſider with me that Paul being, as uſually he was, in peregrination, Titus could not tell where he was: Paul therefore being at Nicopolis wrote as any diſcreet ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would in the like caſe. Come to me to Nicopolis, for I meane to winter there. whereas if he had written as the Refuter would have had him, Titus might have ſayd, where Paul? as being vncerteine where Paul was &amp; whither him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe was to goe.</hi> It ſeemeth the Doctor eyther did not conſider, or would not take notice. 1. that it was needleſſe for Titus to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, where Paul was at the writing of this epiſtle; ſeing he was not to goe preſently to him, but to make himſelfe ready to come upon a new meſſage, as theſe words declare, <hi>when I ſhall ſend Artemas to thee, or Tichicus, be diligent to come to me.</hi> 2. that Paul his being then in peregrination (as the D. conceiveth) doth very probably argue the contrarie to that which he collecteth; to wit, that as yet he was not come to Nicopolis, were he reſolved to ſpend the winter, and to wait for Titus his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming thither. But becauſe the Doct. would ſeeme to build upon the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon judgement of ſuch as are diſcreet; I very willingly ſubmit the triall of this difference to the diſcreet reader (which obſerveth in the writings and ſpeaches of them that are diſcreet, the different uſe of theſe adverbs; <hi>hic</hi> &amp; <hi>illic here</hi> &amp; <hi>there)</hi> whether it ſtand with diſcretion. 1. for the K.

And if he ſay, <hi>here I meane to winter,</hi> to ſend to his Mr. for new dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction where to find him.</p>
                     <p>As for the teſtimony of Athanaſius, Oecumenius and others, which following the error of him that firſt i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>magined Paul to be at Nicopolis, when he wrote to Titus, drunk it in without any further examination; it cannot overweight the force of any juſt probability to the contrary, for in queſtions of this nature (yea of greater event often times) the heedleſſe receiving of that which ſome one or moe of the Ancients have imbraced, hath bin the cauſe of many errors. But if the reſt of his witneſſes be no more reſolute for him, then the authors of the Centuries; he might well have ſpared the citing of them, for they leave it doubtfull whether the epiſtle were ſent from Epheſus or Nicopolis.</p>
                     <p>In the next place, he urgeth the generall conſent of the ancient <note place="margin">Sect. 2. ad ſect. 18. pag 107. &amp;c.</note> Fathers as Euſebius, Dyoniſius, Dorotheus, Ambroſe, Hierom, Chryſoſtome and others to the number of 16. which teſtify that Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy and Titus were Biſhops. To all which, he received a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold anſwer. Frſt that the fathers in ſo calling them, take not the name properlie for the functio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a Dioceſan or provincial Biſhop; but improperlie &amp; in a more generall ſignification; like as they call ſome of the Apoſtles, Biſhops, for the work and preheminence ſake, wherein Biſhops afterwards ſucceeded them. This anſwere is wittingly miſtaken of the Doctor for a bare deniall of that which they affirme: wherefore it ſhall ſuffice to urge him vnto the proofe of the point denyed (and by him wholly neglected) ſcz, that the Fathers did ſo term them properly as giving them the very functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Dioceſan Biſhops for which he pleadeth. Secondly, he was tolde, their conſent was not ſo generall as he would make us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve; the truth of which anſwer is evident by this, that among all the fathers ſummoned to give in their evidence; we heare not the names of Ignatius, Irenaeus, Tertullian, or any other that lived in the firſt 300. yeares. For that counterfeyt that ſhrowdeth himſelf under the name of Dyoniſius Areopagita, is demonſtrated by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny worthy divines, (D. Reynolds Conf. with Hart. cap. 8. diviſ. 2. pag. 488. Cent. 1. lib. 2. de Dyoniſ. Areopag. Perkins problem
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:14068:280"/> pag. 9. Scult. Medull: de Dyoniſ. ſcript. pag. 484.) to be ſuch a novice that he was unknowne to Euſebius and Hierom or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the ancients, before Gregorie the great. Wherefore, it will give the Doct. little reliefe to graunt him, that in his time, it was generally received, that Timothy was Biſhop of Epheſus; eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeing the Papiſts may alſo from his teſtimonie likewiſe conclude, that in his time the Monkes were of great credit in the Church, &amp; many of their ceremonies (as annoyntings, croſſings, Incenſe, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrations &amp;c. were in vſe; and that in his time it was generally co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                     <p>And whereas unto that objected out of Ignatius (that he was ſo farre from eſteeming Timothy as a Biſhop, that he rather maketh him a Deacon. (epiſt. ad Trall.) the Doctor anſwereth by diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing the times, that he was ſuch an Evangeliſt, as firſt miniſtred to Paul as a Deacon, afterwards was ordeyned a Presbyter, &amp; laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Biſhop; he explayneth not but rather perverteth Ignatius his meaning, whoſe purpoſe is nothing elſe, but to ſhew what ſervice Deacons doe owe to Biſhops, by compariſon of that ſervice; which holy Steven did to bleſſed Iames, &amp; Timotheus &amp; Linus unto Paul &amp;c. In which compariſon though he match Tim. with the Deaco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and not vvith the Biſhop (as T. C. rightly obſerveth) yet as he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not to Paul the function of a Biſhop; ſo neyther unto Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the office of a Deacon. Nay rather he ſhadoweth out in Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the office of an Evangeliſt, in that he maketh him, an aſſiſtant unto Paul in his Apoſtleſhip. As for that fancie vvhich the Doct. broacheth, <hi>of Timothies ſerving firſt in the office of a Deacon, then of a Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter, &amp; laſtly of a Biſhop;</hi> it is not for his credit, to father it upon Ignatius or Ambroſe, It is true, that Ambroſe ſaith Timothy was ordeyned a presbyter and that he was a Biſhop, becauſe he had no other presbyters before him: yet affirmeth he withall, <hi>that there is but vna ordinatio epiſcopi &amp; preſbyteri, that there is but one ordination of a Biſhop and a Preſbyter, vter<expan>

                     <p>Here perhaps the Doctor will againe put us in minde of Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius, <note place="margin">Sect. 3.</note> who reporteth out of former hiſtories, that Timothy firſt had the Biſhoprick of the Church of Epheſus, &amp; Titus of the Churches in Creet. And becauſe this his report is the maine foundation, whereon all the reſt are grounded, I will vouchſafe it this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar anſwer following. It is worth the noting that what he ſpeaketh, he delivereth, not as a certain truth grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded on the holy ſcriptures; but as a doubtfull report derived from other ſtories; from whence no ſure proofe can be drawne in divinitie, as before hath bene ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. But (not to inſiſt on this exception) why doth not the D. fortify the conſequence of this argument? Timothy obteyned firſt <hi>(epiſcopen)</hi> the overſight <hi>(tes paroikias)</hi> of the Church in Epheſus, like as Titus had of all the Churches in Creet. Ergo they had each of them the function of a Dioceſan Biſhop in thoſe Churches. For Timothyes charge being <hi>paroikia en epheſoo</hi> the pariſh in Epheſus; was too narrow a compaſſe for a Dioceſe; &amp; Titus having the overſight of all the Churches in Creta (an Iland that had an 100. cities, and therefore called <hi>hekatompolis)</hi> had too large a juriſdiction for one province. Moreover, ſince there are no records of like authoritie to ſhew that any one Biſhop in the Apoſtles dayes, enjoyed the like ſuperintendencie over all the Churches of any kingdome or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie; we have reaſon to think that Titus his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion was extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie. In deed Theodoret on 1. Tim. 3. and Chryſoſtom. Hom. 10. on 2. Tim. doe give as large juriſdiction to Timothy as to Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, yea farre more large, eſteeming him to have the charge of all in Aſia, as Titus had in Creta. But Chryſoſtome plainely ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that this was extraordinary; for of Titus he ſheweth, that how ſoever Paul co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted ſo great a charge to him, becauſe he was one of his companions, a man of whoſe fidelitie he had good proofe, &amp;
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:14068:281"/> in whom he put much confidence (Hom. 1. in epiſt. ad Tit.) yet it was never his meaning that his burthen ſhould lye by continuall ſucceſſion on the ſhoulders of any one man. Hom. 2. in Tit. 1. 5. <hi>Per civitates inquit: ne<expan>

When alſo Chryſoſtome &amp; ſome others doe match them in extent of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction extraordinary, doth not the Doctor argue looſely, in drawing their teſtimony to juſtify that peculiar function of a dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſan Biſhop, which he giveth unto Timothy and Titus? Eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſeing it is evident by Euſebius his owne wordes (lib. 3. cap. 31. &amp; 32.) that he acknowledgeth the firſt and neereſt ſucceſſors of the Apoſtles (among whom he reckoneth Timothy and Titus) to be for the moſt part Evangeliſts, and plainely diſtinguiſheth them from others, which were more properly Paſtors or Biſhops. And we have before obſerved out of <hi>Dorotheus,</hi> that Timothy had no ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led continuance at Epheſus, as Biſhops have on that one Church, whereto they are affixed. Ambroſe alſo maketh S. Paul a fellow Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop with Timothy; when on 1. Tim. 1. 3. he giveth this note: <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrat epiſcopus coepiſcopum ſuum.</hi> And Hierome (though he gave the name of a Biſhop unto Titus) allotteth to him the peregrination of an Evangeliſt, in ſaying (if the Catalogue of eccleſiaſticall writers in his firſt tome, be his) that he preached the goſpell aſwell in the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands lying round about, as in Creta it ſelfe; and that the Apoſtle did therefore call him away from Creta, quia eum haberet neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium in evangelij miniſterium; becauſe he was neceſſarie for him for the miniſtery of the goſpell.

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:14068:282"/> this anſwere, he perverteth it to an other purpoſe then was meant, ſaying, <hi>It is</hi> all one with the ſecond objection already anſwered (viz that the ſcripture calleth Timothy an Evangeliſt, and therefore he was no Biſhop) but the beſt is; if that had bene ſo.

                     <p>As for the newe writers whom he alleadgeth (pag. 110.) for a new ſupply to concurre with the Fathers, for the juſtifying of that Biſhoprick, which he aſcribeth to Timothy and Titus; his friendes may wonder at his impudency, that can doe this without bluſhing. Mr Calvin, he ſaith, &amp; the authors of the Centuries doe affirm, <hi>that Timothy was the Pastor of the Church of Epheſus;</hi> he ſhould have added, &amp; with all proved, that by the name of a Paſtor, they meane a Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſan Bp, ſuch as ours. But the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary is manifeſt, firſt, by the cold allowance which the authors of the Centuries give to Timothyes Biſhoprick. (Cent. 1. lib. 2. col. 614.) when they ſay, they can finde no certeintie, in any approved writer, quomodo aut quam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diu, after what manner and how long, <hi>Epheſianae eccleſiae Doctor &amp; gubernator prefuerit;</hi> he was teacher and governour of the Church of Epheſus: But eſpecially by that which Mr Calvin ſaith, on 2.

As for that preſidencie which D.

In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner I ſay with Beza, that Timothy was the <hi>proestoos;</hi> but that a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident of a presbytery is according to Bezaes language a Biſhop, that is to ſay, a Dioceſan Biſhop, ſuch as ours, as the Doct. would have the reader to conceive) it is ſo foul an untruth, that he cannot without check of conſcience avouch it; ſeing he cannot be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that Beza every where diſclaimeth, that ſole and ſingular pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence, which the Doctor with the Romaniſts aſcribe to Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and Titus.

I forbeare to lay downe the particulars which are urged to this purpoſe, the Doct. may peruſe at his leyſure, what is written by D. Reynoldes in his Conf. with Hart, the place before noted. And Doctor Whitak. de pont: Rom. pag. 353.-359. Catal. teſt: verit; col. 61. laſt edition, and confute their reaſons if he can. He ſhall ſurely therein gratify the Romaniſts, for Bellarmin (convinced with the arguments on our ſide alleadged) confeſſeth that Peter was not then at Rome, when Paul came thither, and from thence wrote ſo many epiſtles (as thoſe to the Coloſ. Epheſ. Galat. Philip. and others) which make no mencio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Peter: Now if Peter were not at Rome in thoſe two years of Pauls remayning priſoner there, how could he joine with Paul at that time in ordeyning Linus to the Biſhoprick of the Church of Rome? Add herevnto thoſe perſwaſions, which induce
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:14068:285"/> us to think that he had no ſuch function at that time, with Pauls allowance. For why ſhould he forget his paines, or deny him that honor (which he affoardeth to others, that were his felow-workmen in the Miniſtery of the Goſpell) to make mencion of his name and labours, at leaſt in ſome one of thoſe many epiſtles, that he wrote from Rome in the time of his aboad there? yea, had he bin the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Rome, when the Apoſtle Paul ſent ſo many epiſtles from thence to other Churches; would not he rather have made choiſe of him to joine hands with him, in the Inſcriptions of the epiſtles to the Philip: and Coloſſia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s; then of Timothy, who in the D. opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion; was eyther yet ſtanding in the degree of a presbyter, or if a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, the Biſhop of Epheſus in another country? In deed his name is remembred among other that ſent ſalutations to Timothy: (2. Tim. 4. 21.) but ſince it is without any note of preheminence ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in office or labours; it argueth ſtrongly that Paul was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of any ſuch epiſcopall charge or ſuperiority, as the D. alloweth him. 10. yeares before Pauls death.</p>
                     <p>As for the ancient Fathers and Hiſtoriographers, Euſebius (the <note place="margin">Sect. 4.</note> D. beſt witnes for computation of times) expreſly ſaith. lib. 3. ca. 2.) Linus obteyned the Biſhoprick of the Church of Rome after the Martyrdome of Peter and Paul; which cutteth off the firſt ten yeares, which the Doctor giveth him, in the government of that Church. But Damaſus, whoſe report the D. imbraceth as if it were an oracle (ſerm. pag. 23.) affirmeth (in pontificali de Petro) that Linus ended his race in the Conſulſhip of Capito &amp; Rufus; which was more then one yeare before the death of Peter and Paul, as D. Whitakers ſheweth de pont: Rom: pag. 343. Wherevnto Iunius alſo aſſenteth. (Animadverſ. in Bellar. cont. 3. lib. 2. ca. 5. not 15 and 18. I forbeare to proſecute that variety of opinions in all writers old and new touching the firſt Biſhop of Rome; and the order of their ſucceſſion; ſome giving to Clemens the firſt place; ſome confounding Cletus, and Anacletus, &amp; ſome ſevering them; and ſome conjoyning Linus and Cletus togither in the epiſcopall charge as doth Rufinus: prefat: recognit: Clement: But ſince there is ſuch diſagreement, and the ſame ſo great, that it perplexeth the learnedeſt favourites of the Romiſh ſucceſſion: it may give us juſt cauſe to affirme; that their teſtimonie can yeeld no certaine proofe of any one (whether Linus, Clemens, or any other) that by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles appointm<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, had the ſingular and ſetled preheminence of a
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:14068:286"/> Biſhop in the Church of Rome.</p>
                     <p>It followeth concerning Mark the Evangeliſt, whom the Doctor <note place="margin">Sect. 5.</note> affirmeth to be the firſt Biſhop at Alexandria, by the appointment of Peter; and that teſtified, as he ſaith, by <hi>Nicephorus, Gregorie, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius, Hierom</hi> and <hi>Dorotheus.</hi> In deed <hi>Nicephorus</hi> is worthy to be the foreman of the Doctors Iurie in this queſtion, for who fitter to caſt a cloak of truth upon a fable, then one known to be the author<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of many fables? Of S. Mark many things are repeated in the ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, that will hardly be brought to accord, with his ſuppoſed Biſhoprick at Alexandria, or with that which the Doctor affirmeth of him, to wit, <hi>that he was Peters diſciple, and his perpetuall follower.</hi> For, to overpaſſe his firſt attendance on Paul and Barnabas (Act. 12 25. &amp; 13. 4. 5. 13) and on Barnabas when he was parted from Paul (Act. 15. 37. 39.) he was with Paul at Rome, as one of his work-fellowes unto Gods kingdome: (Coloſſ. 4. 10. 11. Philem. verſ. 24.) and departed thence to viſite the Saints at Coloſſe, and in other Churches adjoyning (Col. 4. 10.) and he was with Timothy or neer to him, when Paul wrote his laſt ep: to him. (2. Tim. 4. 11.) But to overthrow his Biſhoprick the very name of an Evangeliſt, which the Doctors beſt witneſſes, with one conſent, allow him, is ſufficient; ſeing we have before proved, that an Evangeliſt could not aſſume the office of a Dioceſan Biſhop. Neyther can the Do: take that exception againſt Mark, which he doth againſt Timothy &amp; Titus (ſcz. <hi>that be was but in the degree of a Preſbyter;</hi> ſeing he gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth him to be one of thoſe, that are <hi>kat hexochen</hi> called Evangeliſts Epheſ. 4. 11. (cap. 4. ſect. 12. pag. 95.) Moreover that which Euſebius and Ierom doe report of his writing his goſpell at Rome, according to that which Peter had there preached, and of his ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying it into Egypt, and preaching it in Alexandria, (ſee Euſeb, lib. 2. cap. 14. &amp; 15. Hieron. catal. in Marco) this I ſay, is contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by Irenaeus, more ancient then both, for he (lib. 3. ca. 1.) te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth; that Mark wrote his goſpel after the death of Peter &amp; Paul. And this teſtimony contradicteth alſo an other report of his wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, Euſebius, Ierom and Dorotheus, viz. that Anianus ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Mark in the government of the Church at Alexandria, in the 8. yeare of Nero, as being then and there Martyred. For the Doct. himſelf (ſerm. pag. 82.) referreth the Martyrdome of Peter &amp; Paul to the very later end of Nero his reigne which was 4. or 5. yeares after.
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:14068:286"/> Againe, howſoever ſome doe give him the name of a Biſhop; yet nothing is ſayd by any one, that can conclude the function of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, <note place="margin">Sect. 6.</note> as being affixed to the charge of one Church. Yea rather, they all give him not onely the name, but alſo the right function of an Evangeliſt; not onely in accompanying the Apoſtles; but alſo in traveiling from place to place, to plant and eſtabliſh Churches. And among the reſt Nicephorus, moſt fully juſtifyeth him to be a right Evangeliſt. For (lib. 2. cap. 43.) he reporteth that Mark publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the goſpell not onely in Egypt, but alſo in Libia, and in all Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baria, alſo to them of Pentapolis, and Cykue, and that he there co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted Churches and gave them Biſhops &amp;c. But the Doctors o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſight is moſt to be admired in his bringing of Euſebius to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes <note place="margin">The D. own wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him.</note> his Biſhoprik, at Alexandria. For the contrary appeareth by the order which he obſerveth, in ſetting downe the number and names of ſuch as he accounteth Biſhops of that Church. For in his account Anianus was the firſt, and Abilinus the ſecond. lib. 2. ca. 24. &amp; 3. 12. and Cerdo the third, which after Anianus the firſt Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, governed that Church. lib. 3. cap. 16. What can be more ful and plaine, to ſhewe that in Euſebius his judgement, Anianus (and not Mark) was the firſt Biſhop of Alexandria? As for thoſe words whereon the Doctor buildeth. lib. 2. cap. 24. (that Anianus firſt undertook the publik adminiſtration of the Church at Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria, after Marke the Apoſtle and Evangeliſt) If prejudice had not ſtood in his light, and others in whoſe ſtepps he treadeth: they might have ſeen their groſſe miſtaking of his meaning, who diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſheth him from his ſucceſſors, by the name of an Apoſtle and Evangeliſt. For if Mark muſt needs be the firſt Biſhop; becauſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianus firſt obteyned Biſhoprick after him: then let Peter be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the firſt Biſhop, alſo at Rome; becauſe at Antioche Ignatius was the ſecond Biſhop by ſucceſſion after Peter (Euſeb. lib 3 ca. 30.) And at Rome, Clemens after Peter governed that church Ieron. lib. 1. cont. Iovin. Yea let not Iames any longer be recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the firſt Biſhop of Ieruſalem; becauſe he undertook the charge thereof after the Apoſtles, or rather i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mediately after Chriſts paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But if the Doctor can diſcerne as he doth (ſerm. pag. 82. and 83.) that Euſebius excludeth Peter &amp; Paul from the place or fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a Biſhop at Rome; when he giveth the firſt place to Linus after them, the ſecond to Anacletus and ſo forwards; doth he not wittingly wrong his witneſſes, and deceive his reader, when he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:14068:287"/> their word for a certeine evidence, that Mark was the firſt Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Alexandria; in ſaying, that Anianus did firſt obteyne the government after Mark.</p>
                     <p>In the fourth place, Simeon the ſonne of Cleophas, is by the <note place="margin">Sect. 7. ad p. 112. 113.</note> Doctor produced, as ordeyned by the Apoſtles Biſhop of Ieruſalem after Iames, as Euſebius teſtifieth. lib. 3. cap. 10. But it is little for the credit of the epiſcopall function, that it is inforced to crave aide of ſuch fabulous reportes as flying fame ſcattereth, and he muſt pardon us this fault, that we can hardly credit the tale for if the Apoſtles had thought it neceſſarie, that each Church ſhould be governed by a dioceſan Biſhop, would they have ſuffered Ieruſalem to have wanted one for 10. yeares togither after Iames his death? For Iames lived not above 30. yeares after Chriſts paſſion (as the Doctor acknowledgeth. ſerm. pag. 69.) but the deſtruction of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, which happened before Simeons choyſe as Euſebius ſaith) fell out in the 40. yeare after Chriſts death; Cent. lib. 2. col. 664. was there now, imediately after the cities deſtruction, more need of a Biſhop there, then before? and was the choyſe of their Biſhop a matter of that moment, that all the Apoſtles and Diſciples of Chriſt remayning alive, muſt needes meet togither to make the election? and muſt he needes be one of Chriſts kindred? yet let it be granted (ſince the Doctor will have it ſo) that Simeon was the next vnto Iames in the government of the Church of Ieruſalem, as Euſebius affirmeth, and be it granted alſo that Iohn ordeyned Policarpe Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Smyrna; and that he conſtituted Biſhops in diverſe other places, and that the Apoſtles in every place committed the Church to Biſhops, and left them their ſucceſſours, as Iren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>us and others teſtify; how will the Doctor prove that all theſe were dioceſan Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, induced with a ſingular power of ordination and juriſdiction in many Churches, or congregations, which is (as his Refuter ſaith) the very ſoul of a dioceſan Biſhop. The Doctor, in his wiſdome paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth by this point, as if he had not ſeene it in his Refuters anſwer, and falſely chargeth him to take exception againſt the aſſertion of the Fathers, which affirme Biſhops to be the ſucceſſors of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles. Whereas it is evident, that he denieth onely the Doctors inference, that from the Fathers affirmation concludeth dioceſan Biſhops, ſuch as ours, to be of Apoſtolicall inſtitution. <hi>This ariſeth (ſaith he) from the miſtaking of the word Biſhop, which in the firſt tymes ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified no more then an ordinarie Paſtor.</hi> Wherefore ſince the Doctor
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:14068:287"/> doth nothing elſe, but in an ydle floriſh repeat that, which he had in effect before delivered (viz. that the Apoſtles derived their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, aſwell for government as for doctrine vnto Biſhops) we ſhould but waſte wordes and time in vaine, if we ſhould vouchſafe him any other anſwere, then that already given and remaineth yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched.</p>

                        </note> this for the concluſion, which he intendeth to prove, viz. that Biſhops were ordeyned of God; which change we can be content to allowe; ſo that he will acknowledge his error in conceyving theſe latter proofes to be more direct then the former: for he fetcheth a farre more large compaſſe, by conſequence to conclude his maine doctrine; ſeing there is much more difference, betwene the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of a function, and the ordination of the perſons therevnto, then can be imagined betwene an Apoſtolicall and divine inſituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Wherefore, (not to ſpend time about wordes, but) to come directly to the pith of his reaſoning, he is content his argument ſhall paſſe as his Refuter framed it, thus;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If God ordeyned Timothy Archippus, and the Angels of the 7. Churches Biſhops, then were Biſhops ordeyned of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But God ordeyned them Biſhops: Ergo, Biſhops were ordeyned of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this argument he received this anſwere (which the Doctor concealeth from the reader in his defenſe) viz. that the aſſumption being vnderſtood of dioceſan Biſhops (of which his concluſion ſpeaketh) is vtterly falſe. We are therefore once againe to ſee how the particulars of his aſſumption are proved.</p>
                     <p>Firſt touching Timothy, his argument muſt run in this forme,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>He that was ordeyned a dioceſan Biſhop; by propheſy (that is by divine revelation) he was ordeyned a dioceſan Biſhop by God.</hi>

                     <pb n="160" facs="tcp:14068:288"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But Timothy was ordeyned a dioceſan Biſhop by propheſy. 1. Tim. 4. 14.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ergo, Timothy was ordeyned a dioceſan Biſhop by God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here againe, (as he was tolde) the aſſumption faileth. Timothy was no Biſhop at all properly; In deede he received his Miniſtery by propheſy, but it was the Miniſterie of an Evangeliſt, not of a dioceſan Biſhop. In which anſwere the diſcreete reader may ſee, that one branch of his aſſumption is graunted, to wit, that Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy received his Miniſtrie by propheſy: and the other was and is denied, ſcz. that his Miniſtery was not (as the Doctor ſaith) the function of a dioceſan Biſhop. Now what is Mr. Doctors defence? Forſooth, firſt he repeateth his proofes out of the fathers, which ſhewe that which was before graunted, viz. that by propheſy (1. Ti. 4. 14.) is meant divine revelation; or the holy Ghoſts oracle: but in ſtead of proving the point denied (ſcz. that the miniſtery which Timothy received by propheſy, was a dioceſan Biſhoprick) he falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth <note place="margin">The Doct. falſfyeth his Refut. anſwer in ſtead of proving.</note> his refut: anſwer, perſwading his reader that he onely denyed Tim: to be a Bp. And to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradict him in this, he urgeth nothing, but one ſentence of Mr Calvin, who ſaith, <hi>that he was choſen by O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralce into the order of Pastars,</hi> &amp; then argueth full feebly in this faſhio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. <hi>If he were a Paſtor, it is not to be doubted, but he was a Biſhop.</hi> For wee have before ſhewed, that howſoever Mr Calvin give Timothy the name of a Paſtor, yet he held him to be an Evangeliſt, and not properly a Paſtor and a Biſhop, in that ſenſe, as the words are to be taken in this quaeſtion.</p>
                     <p>To cloſe vp this part, that the Doctor may ſee to how good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, he hath beſtowed his paines in proving Timothy his ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">Sect. 2.</note> to proceed from extraordinary revelation; I will retort his owne argument, againſt the concluſion which he ſhould have main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned, in this manner;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Whoſoever receyved his Ministery originally (not firm humane election, but) by propheſy, or divine revelation: he held the fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>

                     <p>The aſſumption is that, whereon the Doctor raiſeth his owne argument. The truth of the propoſition may be cleared by the view of thoſe particulars, whoſe calling we find in the Scriptures,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:14068:288"/> to be originally derived from divine aſſignement: as (to let paſs the Prophets of the olde Teſtament) Iohn Baptiſt and Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, his 12. Apoſtles, and Matthias choſen into the roome of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das, Paul and Barnabas added to the colledge of the Apoſtles, alſo Philip amonge the Evangeliſtes, and Agabus amonge the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. For among other notes whereby we knowe, they had an extraordinary Miniſterie, this is not the leaſt, that their authority to preach the Goſpell, was given them from Heaven, or from God, and not from men. Math. 21. 25. Luk. 1. 17. &amp; 3. 2. 4. Iohn. 1. 6. Math. 10. 1.-5. &amp; 28. 18. 19. Acts. 1. 24. 26. Gal. 1. 1. 15. and that God ratified their Miniſtery, either by his owne voice. Math. 17. 5. Acts. 9. 4. &amp; 13. 2. or by miracles, Ioh. 3. 2. Acts. 2. 22. &amp; 4. 16. 31. &amp; 8. 5. 6. or by ſome other cleare evidence. Acts. 11. 19. 21. &amp; verſ. 27. 28. &amp; 18. 24. 25. 28. ſufficient to convince the conſciences of all that did not wilfully ſhut their eyes againſt the light. But in ſuch as exerciſed the ordinary functions of Deacons and Elders or Biſhops, we finde that they had the originall of their calling from humane election Acts. 6. 3. 5, &amp; 14. 23. Tit. 1. 5. 7. and vpon true triall of their fitnes before taken. 1. Tim. 3. 2.-10. &amp; 5. 22.) If the Doctor can yeeld us any one Inſtance from the Scriptures to the contrary, we will gladly give him the hearing. Meane while, it maketh much both againſt his aſſertion, that holdeth him to have the ordinary function of a dioceſan Biſhop: and for ours, which affirme him to be an Evangeliſt.</p>
                     <p>Secondly touching Archippus he alloweth the argument which <note place="margin">Sect. 3. ad pag. 141.</note> his Refuter framed, with this explanation, that by epiſcopall Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery, he vnderſtandeth the function of a dioceſan Biſhop; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his argument, ſo explained ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>neth thus,</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Archippus received the function of a dioceſan Biſhop in the Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>

                     </p>
                     <p>The propoſition as it now ſtandeth, is taken of the Doctor to be of ſo abſolute a truth that no exception can be taken againſt it. notwithſtanding, it is queſtionable, whether thoſe wordes of Saint Paul, Coloſ. 4. 17; <hi>in the Lord,</hi> muſt needes be interpreted, as the Doctor conceyveth <hi>by the Lords ordinance?</hi> he ſhould have ſayd <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination,</hi> becauſe he thence inferreth, that the perſon ſo receyving his Miniſtery, is ordeyned of God therevnto. For although we can
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:14068:289"/> willingly graunt, that the Doctor hath received his Miniſtery in the Lord, and according to, Gods ordinance; yet, me thinks he ſhould not eaſily aſſume to himſelf this honor, <hi>to hve his ordination from God.</hi> And who would not have conceived by the former argument con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Timothy, that his meaning (in ſaying Biſhops were ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of God) had bin to prove, that the perſons in whome he In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanceth, received their calling to the Miniſterie, originally from Gods nomination; and ſo were ordeyned of God, by his ſpeciall, and more then ordinary direction? Notwithſtanding if he will needes have his concluſion thus conſtrued, <hi>that Biſhops were ordeyned of God,</hi> that is, that they received their function with divine appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation: we will contend no longer againſt the propoſition of his argument: it ſhall ſuffice for the overthrowe of his concluſion, to ſupplant the Aſſumption.</p>
                     <p>And herevnto the leſſe labour will ſerve, ſeing we have already ſhewed, that Archippus, if he were a Biſhop of that Church, yet) could not be a dioceſan Biſhop, ſuch as ours. For Epaphras their firſt Teacher, ſtill continued one of them, and a faithfull Miniſter of Chriſt for them. Coloſſ. 1. 7. &amp; 4. 12. And Archippus is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected vnto the Churches admonition and cenſure, (in the very words wherevnto the Doctor ſendeth us.) Coloſſ. 4. 17. which is <hi>palaion</hi> in deed, but <hi>nimis apoſtolicum, too apostolicall for our times,</hi> as Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus upon thoſe wordes ſaith.) But let us ſee what releef, the Doctor (foreſeeing that his aſſumption would be denied) yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to ſupport it. <hi>For proofe hereof,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>it ſufficeth me, that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chippus was (as Ambroſe noteth in Coloſ. 4. 17. Biſhop of Coloſse, which was a citie; ſeeing I have manifeſtly proved before, that the Biſhops of cities, were dioceſan Biſhops.</hi> And muſt this proofe needs ſuffice others, becauſe it ſufficieth him? knoweth he not, that we expect he ſhould yeeld <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s ſome cleare proofe from the holy ſcripture? why made he ſhew at the firſt, as though he would prove, Archippus his Biſhoprick from Coloſ. 4. 17. and now falleth from thoſe words of Paul, to the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of Ambroſe, who lived well nigh 400. yeares after? Belike (upon his ſecond thoughts) he diſcerned, that the ſame exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion uſed to Archippus, which he gave to Timothy (2. Tim. 4. 5.) doth not neceſſarily argue, that he had the ſame office? Or elſe he thought, he ſhould prevaile little in ſo arguing, with thoſe which hold Timothy to have bin an Evangeliſt, and not a Biſhop. And ſurely, it availeth his cauſe as little, to ſend us to S. Ambroſe, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:14068:289"/> he hath not one word, that can argue a dioceſan Biſhoprick in Archippus, he calleth him, <hi>praepoſitum illorum et rectorem, qui post Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phram accepit regendam eorum eccleſiam.</hi> Which may argue I grant an epiſcopall miniſtery at large; but will not ſerve to conclude the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminent ſuperiority of a dioceſan Biſhop. Nay this is rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed by Ambroſe, who ſaith of Epaphras, that he was <hi>(<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>His aſſumption therefore, having no releife, neyther from the <note place="margin">Sect. 4.</note> Apoſtle Paul, nor yet from S. Ambroſe; relieth wholly upon this poore argument, borrowed from ſome other parts of his defence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Biſhops of cities were dioceſan Biſhops: Archippus was Biſhop of Coloſſe which was a citie. Ergo, he was a dioecſan Biſhop.</hi> I anſwer firſt to the propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which he ſaith he hath before manifeſtly proved. Although Biſhops were Dioceſans, whence once the whole body of people inhabiting cities became ſubject to the overſight of one Biſhop; yet the firſt Biſhops of Churches planted in cities, were not dioceſan Biſhops; for the Churches whereof they were Biſhops; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but a ſmall handful to a large heap in compariſon to the whole citie; could not be properly dioceſes, as we have ſufficiently ſhewed in our anſwer to all his proofes produced to the contrary.</p>
                     <p>Secondly to his aſſumpion, I anſwer, that as it is a knowne vntruth to affirme the citie of Coloſſe, to have bin vnder the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Archippus: ſo neyther is it true; that he had that ſole or ſingular preheminence, over the Church of Coloſſe, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perteyneth to Biſhops ſuch as the Do. contendeth for. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he will hereafter indeavor, to make good the aſſertion, <hi>that Archippus was a dioceſan Biſhop, &amp; ſo ordeyned of God;</hi> he muſt ſeek out ſome more pregnant proofes, then his ſtudy for his ſermon, &amp; the defenſe thereof hath as yet affoarded him.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly as touching the Angells of the 7. Churches, whereas he ſhould conclude the ſame, which he had affirmed of Timothy and Archippus, <hi>viz. that they were ordeyned of God,</hi> he altereth the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to this, <hi>that they had divine institution and approbation, for their fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <p>The aſſumption which he knew would not without good proofe be admitted; he ſaith, he went not about to prove now, becauſe it was proved at large in the former part of the ſermon. And ſince he hath added nothing elſe for the proofe thereof; but that which is anſwered to the full already, till ſome better evidence come in place; his concluſion muſt lie in the duſt. And we may I hope with the Readers good allowance conclude; that he hath not any one argument, from any part of the Canonicall ſcripture, to ſhew that that the function of dioceſan Biſhops ſuch as ours be; is of divine inſtitution. There remaineth now that leaving the ſcriptures, we examine that firſt argument of his 3. touching the government of the Churches, the firſt. 300. yeares after Chriſt, handled by him. ſerm. pag. 56. 60. &amp; defenſe lib. 4. cap. 1. where all his humane teſtimonies come to be handled, but becauſe this ſecond part is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready large enough, I will here break of; and referre the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, togither with that firſt point of his five, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth governing Elders, to the third part.</p>
